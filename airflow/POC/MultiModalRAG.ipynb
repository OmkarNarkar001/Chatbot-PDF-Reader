Hensel, Ezra, and Ilkiw (1991) defined attribution as the “mathemati- cal process of explaining an investment return by relating it to the different risk-taking decisions implicit in the portfolio, and the extent to which each of those risks was rewarded or penalized in the capital markets” (p. 66). Colin (2014) said that the purpose of attribution is to disentangle the fund’s overall\\n\\nreturn into the component returns generated by each risk.\\n\\nIn other words, attribution measures which of your investment decisions about the portfolio’s underlying risks worked and which did not. This infor- mation is critical business intelligence for anyone involved in selecting, man- aging, or marketing investments. As the authors noted above, Fischer and Wermers (2013) considered attribution analysis to be the “description and the quantification of key factors on the returns of investment portfolios” (p. 395). DiBartolomeo (2003) considered performance attribution to be the process of disentangling component portions of the observed returns to draw conclu-\\n\\nsions about the strengths and weaknesses of the investment process.\\n\\nNote that these definitions are similar. The central question of an attribu- tion analysis is thus the following: To which investment decisions can the active\\n\\nreturn of a portfolio relative to its benchmark be traced over a given period?\\n\\nFormally, Bacon (2008) stated that “performance attribution is a tech- nique used to quantify the excess return of a portfolio against its benchmark into the active decisions of the investment decision process” (p. 117). Murira and Sierra (2006) considered performance attribution the ex post complement\\n\\nto the ex ante risk decomposition provided by the risk measurement process.\\n\\n“Performance attribution” is, therefore, perhaps a misleading term: As these descriptions suggest, the excess, active, or relative return is examined,\\n\\nnot the whole of the return (or absolute return). “Relative return attribution”\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n1\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nor simply “attribution analysis” is perhaps better terminology. Absolute attri- bution, or simply contribution analysis, would explain the sources of return of a portfolio in isolation rather than in comparison with a benchmark.\\n\\nAs described in Bacon (2008), attribution analysis is a critical manage- ment tool for several key stakeholders in the asset management process. Above all, it is the main tool for performance analysts because it allows them to ensure that the return is correct. It allows them to participate in the invest- ment decision process by enabling them to demonstrably add value and thus justify their salary and effort. Return attribution, together with risk analy- sis, is the tool that allows the analyst to understand the sources of return in the portfolio and to communicate that understanding to portfolio managers,\\n\\nsenior managers, and asset owners.\\n\\nInvestment management firms themselves, and the portfolio managers they employ, are also major users of attribution analysis. Attribution analy- sis provides a good starting point for a dialogue with asset owners on the positive and negative aspects of recent performance. Attribution analysis can be used aggressively to identify underperformance early and provide clients with a thorough explanation of underperformance and, hopefully, a rationale for improving performance. Attribution analysis is also crucial in gaining the confidence of asset owners by demonstrating a good understanding of the\\n\\ndrivers of performance.\\n\\nPortfolio managers inhabit the front office of asset management firms; typically, performance analysts inhabit the middle office. The back office is also able to use daily, security-level attribution, however, as a diagnostic tool\\n\\nfor identifying pricing and transaction errors.\\n\\nBacon (2008) also stated that “senior management take an active interest in attribution analysis to provide them with a tool to monitor their portfolio managers. They will be keen to identify performance outliers—good or bad—\\n\\nand to ensure that value is added consistently across the firm” (p. 117).\\n\\nHence, attribution analysis has numerous uses across a wide range of asset management stakeholders.\\n\\nLord (1997) suggested that the characteristics of a good attribution sys-\\n\\ntem would include the following:\\n\\n¢ aconsistent approach for analysing returns,\\n\\na consistent approach for analysing returns,\\n\\ne asolid theoretical framework for valuation,\\n\\na solid theoretical framework for valuation,\\n\\ne the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,\\n\\nthe ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,\\n\\nattribution factors consistent with decision variables of the portfolio strat-\\n\\negy process,\\n\\n2\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\n• summary attribution analysis constructed from security details, which\\n\\nthemselves should be available for inspection,\\n\\ne transactions, and\\n\\ntransactions, and\\n\\n• robust analytic systems and high-quality data to provide meaningful\\n\\nattribution results.\\n\\nMurira and Sierra (2006) suggested that there is general agreement that\\n\\nan attribution framework must meet two key requirements:\\n\\n1. It should be consistent with the investment decision-making process of the portfolio. Performance attribution is most useful if it mirrors the investment management process because, in that case, it enables the iden-\\n\\ntification and explanation of the sources of excess return.\\n\\n2. It should be compatible with the organization’s performance measurement and risk measurement systems. Managers would have difficulty making effective use of the information provided by the performance attribution process if the data being explained by this process were inconsistent with\\n\\nthe data originating from the internal risk and performance systems.\\n\\nAs in many literature reviews, here the approach to the task is historical— beginning with the first attempts at performance measurement, about a half-\\n\\ncentury ago, and progressing to the present.\\n\\nEarly Development\\n\\nArguably, comparative performance measurement began with Dietz’s (1966) Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance and the Bank Administration Institute (BAI 1968) report Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison. The purpose of the BAI study was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The main\\n\\nconclusions of their study are still relevant:\\n\\n1. Performance measurement returns should be based on market value, not cost.\\n\\nReturns should be total returns.\\n\\nwk\\n\\n2. Returns should be total returns.\\n\\nReturns should be time weighted. &\\n\\n3. Returns should be time weighted.\\n\\nPerformance should include risk as well as return.\\n\\n4. Performance should include risk as well as return.\\n\\nFunds should be classified according to their investment objectives.\\n\\n5. Funds should be classified according to their investment objectives.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n3\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nAlthough the report did not recommend the use of attribution analysis— instead, emphasizing the importance of the total return of the portfolio—it did suggest that comparison of various sector returns within the portfolio might be useful. Interestingly, Eugene Fama was later invited to write and\\n\\nwrote the chapter on risk for this report.\\n\\nFama Decomposition. Fama was the first to fully delve into the sub- ject of attribution analysis, which he did in “Components of Investment Performance” (Fama 1972). In this seminal paper, Fama suggested breaking down observed return into the part resulting from ability to pick the best securities at a given level of risk (which he at the time called “selectivity”; now, it is often referred to as “selection return”) and the part that is the result of predictions of general market price movements—that is, the return from\\n\\nsystematic risk—as follows:\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nExcess\\n\\nSelectivity\\n\\nSystematic risk\\n\\nwhere:\\n\\naverage portfolio return average market or benchmark return portfolio systematic risk\\n\\naverage risk-free rate\\n\\nIf a portfolio is fully diversified, it incurs no specific risk and the total portfolio risk will equal the systematic risk. Portfolio managers will give up diversification, however, to seek additional return. Therefore, the return from selectivity can be broken down into (1) the additional return required to jus- tify sacrificing a given amount of diversification and (2) the net return from selectivity (the remainder of the manager’s value added). The return from\\n\\nselectivity is equivalent to Jensen’s alpha,\\n\\n.\\n\\nThe term “diversification” (used in a different context from the one we would understand today) “is the return required to justify moving away from the benchmark and taking on specific risk” (Bacon 2013, p. 88). To calcu- late this diversification return, you first have to calculate the effective beta required such that systematic risk alone is equivalent to the total portfolio\\n\\nrisk. This beta is the Fama beta, calculated as follows:\\n\\nB.=—, o\\n\\n4\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Its approach, eventually published in 1972 (SIA 1972), had two aims: (1) the determination of a standard method of calculating a portfolio’s return, so that funds could be fairly compared, and (2) the decomposition of the performance of the fund into two components—selection of individual stocks and selection of stock sectors. The first aim is achieved by calculating the time-weighted rate of return using a simple approximation (which later became known as the analyst’s test method and ultimately became redundant as more accurate time-weighted returns became available). The second aim, the analysis of performance, is produced by constructing “notional funds” based on market\\n\\nindexes and comparing them with actual funds.\\n\\nThis early work dealt with equity-market sectors as the macro level of selection and securities within the sectors as the micro level, but common practice now is to regard asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as the macro level and securities within the asset class as the micro level. Thus, our discussion\\n\\nwill proceed from this latter starting point.\\n\\nThe working group established two notional funds as follows:\\n\\nThe working group established two notional funds as follows:\\n\\ne a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and\\n\\na fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and\\n\\ne apartly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).\\n\\na partly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).\\n\\nNote that the actual fund consists of actual returns and actual weights. The fully restrained fund (sometimes called the “fully notional fund”) represents the return on the policy portfolio—that is, the strategic bench-\\n\\nmark or policy weights set by the asset owner (represented by the pension\\n\\n6\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

(As noted ear- lier, this analysis can also be applied to sector allocation and stock selection within sectors in an exactly parallel way.)

Holbrook, in effect, pulled together the BAI (1968) report, Fama’s (1972) decomposition, and the SIA (1972) report. This virtu- ally unknown paper provides the foundation for much of the development in performance analysis that followed. Directing his advice to pension fund\\n\\ntrustees, Holbrook defined the decision-making process as follows:\\n\\nThe practical management of a pension fund investment portfolio involves\\n\\ndecisions at three levels.\\n\\ni) Policy, i.e. the proportions of the assets which, as a long-term aim, the trustees wish to hold in the different investment mar- kets. The fundamental element of policy is the split between equity-type and fixed-interest investments. Definition of pol- icy may extend to a split of equity-type investments between UK equities, overseas equities and properties, specific pro- portions being set for each. If the trustees are not experts in long-term investment, they will tend to formulate policy in discussion with specialist advisers; it is gratifying to record that actuaries who advise on the financing of pension schemes\\n\\nare increasingly becoming involved in such discussions.\\n\\nii) Strategy, i.e. decisions to depart from the policy proportions in the light of current market conditions, including decisions to hold part of the fund on short-term deposit. The trustees will usually seek advice from experts in the various markets regarding the short-term outlook, up to the time of the next investment meeting and over the next year or so. Except where trustees delegate strategic decisions to managers and advisers, investment meetings are usually held at short regular intervals, and arrangements are made for special meetings whenever it is thought that there has been a material change in market prospects. Often trustees authorize the managers concerned to determine the timing of purchases; thus, a manager is able to retain part of the assets entrusted to him in the form of short- term deposits.\\n\\n8\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\niii) Selection, i.e. the choice of the particular investments to hold, buy or sell within the various markets. Again, practice varies; many trustees give their managers carte blanche in this area—\\n\\nsome keep close control over day-to-day transactions. (p. 20)\\n\\nHolbrook went on to describe the trustees’ needs. First, they need to know whether the fund performed well, moderately, or badly. This knowledge requires the calculation of return, comparisons with market returns, and con-\\n\\nsideration of risk:\\n\\nThe performance of the fund as a whole, and within the different markets and sectors, must be examined separately. Secondly, the trustees need to be advised on the reasons for their fund’s performance; this may be inves- tigated by analysing the results to show contributions to total performance made by policy, strategy, and selection decisions. Finally, the trustees need help in interpreting the results as a guide to future action. Identification of points of strength and weakness in past performance may lead to reconsid- eration of policy and practice, of the decision-making process, and possibly\\n\\nto a change of manager. (p. 21)\\n\\nTo facilitate the breakdown of returns into policy, strategic, and selection\\n\\ndecisions, Holbrook suggested the return calculation of three notional funds:\\n\\nbased on the model, based on the trustees’ policy proportions, and\\n\\nbased on actual allocations.\\n\\nThen, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by\\n\\nThen, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nThe first factor represents the contribution to total performance resulting from the decision to adopt a policy that differs from the equity and fixed- interest proportions in the model [the industry standard allocation between equity and fixed income at the time]. The second, the contribution from the strategic decision to depart from policy proportions. The third, the contribution from selection decisions for the fixed-interest and equity\\n\\nsectors taken together. (Holbrook 1977, p. 31)\\n\\nThis passage is the first articulation of successive notional portfolios each of which isolates one step in the investment decision process. The fact that it\\n\\nwas written in 1977 shows how far ahead of his time Holbrook was.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n9\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nHolbrook (1977) linked this successive notional portfolio approach to Fama’s decomposition by equating the first factor to the investor’s return from systematic risk, the second factor to the manager’s return from systematic risk, and the third factor to selectivity.\\n\\nFoundations\\n\\nThe Brinson Model. The next major development in attribution analysis stems from a series of papers written in the 1980s that collectively describe\\n\\nBrinson attribution.\\n\\nBrinson, Hood, and Beebower’s (1986) “Determinants of Portfolio Performance” is perhaps the most well-known paper on attribution. It pro- vided the name for the most common type of equity attribution model used today: the Brinson model. Despite being a relatively short paper, it made two\\n\\ncontributions:\\n\\n1. The general framework used to decompose total portfolio returns. Brinson et al. (1986) suggested a model for breaking down the arithmetic return in excess of the benchmark (r – b) under the assumption of a standard top-down investment decision process in which the portfolio manager seeks to add value through both timing and security selection. Figure 2 illustrates\\n\\ntheir framework for analysing portfolio returns.\\n\\nQuadrant I represents the policy benchmark return for a period—that is, the return on a hypothetical portfolio wherein the asset-class weights are those in long-term investment policy and the returns are those of the\\n\\nasset-class benchmarks\\n\\n.\\n\\nQuadrant I (9)\\n\\nQuadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.\\n\\nQuadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.\\n\\nIn timing, the portfolio manager seeks to add value by holding asset- class (or sector) weights in the portfolio that are different from the asset-class benchmark weights. An asset-class weight in the portfolio that is greater than the benchmark weight for that asset class would be described as overweight and a lesser weight would be described as underweight. Clearly, the portfolio manager will aim to overweight well-performing asset classes (or sectors) and\\n\\nunderweight poorly performing asset classes.\\n\\nQuadrant II minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-\\n\\ntracted value from timing only.\\n\\n10\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

It is now more commonly considered to be “interaction.”\\n\\nQuadrant IV minus Quadrant III minus Quadrant II plus Quadrant I\\n\\nrepresents the added or subtracted value from interaction.\\n\\n2. In a more controversial practice, the framework is used on a sample of pension funds to demonstrate that most of the difference in returns among pension funds is the result of policy decisions, not timing or selection. This\\n\\nuse of the framework is responsible for much of its fame.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n11\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nAttribution Formulas. Brinson et al. (1986) may be the better known of the “Brinson papers,” but the more important paper in terms of the development of attribution is “Measuring Non-US Equity Portfolio Performance” by Brinson and Fachler (1985). Again, it is a short paper, but it documented for the first time the formulas required to calculate individual attribution effects:\\n\\nn Allocation (Brinson and Fachler [1985] used the term “market selec-\\n\\ntion”). The contribution to excess return from asset allocation in the ith sector is\\n\\nA, =(w, -W.)x(b,-6).\\n\\nn Selection. The contribution to excess return from stock selection in\\n\\nsector i is\\n\\nS,=W,x(r,-4).\\n\\nn Interaction (Brinson and Fachler used the term “cross-product”). The\\n\\ncontribution to excess return from interaction in sector i is\\n\\nI, =(w;, -W,)x(7,—4;).\\n\\nWith a few modifications, these formulas provide the basic foundations for most of the attribution analysis used today. The terms “asset allocation,” “security selection,” and “interaction” are now universal and familiar to all. At the time, however, allocation might have been described as “timing,” “market selection,” or “weighting.” To establish when the term “allocation” was first used is difficult, but Cocks (1972) was among the first. He defined it as “all those decisions by which the portfolio manager allocates his funds among the selected securities (or broad classes of securities)” (p. 3). Asset allocation spe- cifically locates the decision process in what asset classes to hold and in what weights, and this terminology is associated with Ibbotson and Sinquefield\\n\\n(1982), although no one knows when the term was first used.\\n\\nUse of the term “interaction” (or “other” or “cross-product”) is difficult to establish, but certainly, by the early 1990s, “asset allocation,” “security selec-\\n\\ntion,” and “interaction” had become the most commonly used terms.\\n\\nThe Brinson et al. (1986) paper did not provide a formula for individual attribution effects, but the following variation of the allocation formula is\\n\\nassociated with that paper:\\n\\n12\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

(1986) intended this interpretation, and the Brinson and Fachler (1985) variant for asset allocation is far more common and better aligned with most investment decision processes. If the Brinson et al. definition is used, the contribution from asset allocation will be positive for any overweight sector in which the sector return is positive, but it will be positive when using the Brinson–Fachler definition only if the sector\\n\\nreturn exceeds the overall benchmark return.\\n\\nGraphically, the Brinson et al. (1986) method is easier to illustrate for each sector i than the Brinson and Fachler (1985) method, as shown in Figure 3. The contribution to portfolio return from sector i is the total area , and the contribution from the benchmark alone is area . In this example the total contribution from the portfolio in sector i is greater than the contribution from the benchmark.\\n\\nThe attribution to excess return in sector i is the sum of the areas rep- resenting selection , allocation , and interaction . In this particular example, , and ;\\n\\ntherefore, all three contributions are positive.\\n\\nThe Brinson and Fachler (1985) method illustrated in Figure 4 is a little less intuitive. As stated in Bacon (2008), “We observe no change to the areas representing selection and interaction but allocation is now described by the\\n\\narea\\n\\n” (p. 125).\\n\\nFigure 3.

The same formulas as those suggested by Brinson–Fachler and associated with Brinson et al. (1986) can be found in a formal discussion response to a paper by Kingston (1973) presented to the Faculty of Actuaries on 14 October 1974, more than 10 years before the\\n\\nBrinson–Fachler paper was published.\\n\\nThe formulas may well have been developed prior to the publication of the Brinson and Fachler (1985), Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), Brinson, Singer, and Beebower (1991), and Singer (1996) papers, but collectively these papers established attribution analysis as an important aid in the critical review of active strategies and decision-making processes for asset managers,\\n\\nasset consultants, and asset owners.\\n\\nInteraction. Interaction is a controversial effect. Most authors—for example, Laker (2001), Spaulding (2003/2004), Campisi (2004b), and Bacon (2008)—would agree that the interaction effect is a directly calculated term, not a residual, but what does it mean? . . . It is certainly not intuitive. As noted, Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), arguably the first definers of the interaction effect, rather unhelpfully described this effect as “other” or a “cross-product”; they did not use the\\n\\nterm “interaction.” By the early 1990s, the term had become fairly universal\\n\\n14\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The interaction effect is clearly a cross-product, the combination of allocation and selection decisions.\\n\\nLaker (2000) suggested “that when calculated properly, the interaction term plays a valuable role in explaining a portfolio’s active performance, and indeed that sometimes it is clearly more explanatory than the other attributes” (p. 43). Spaulding (2003/2004) was more nuanced in his comments, despite pointing out potentially misleading results (from mispriced securities or investing in sectors not in the benchmark). On balance, Spaulding suggested, it is best to calculate interaction, take the time to do some analysis, and then decide where to assign it, or better yet, show the interaction as a separate item and prepare to explain it. Campisi (2004b) and Bacon (2008) were less supportive of using the interaction effect; they suggested that it is not an active part of the investment decision process and, therefore, need not be calculated. Like many asset managers in practice, they suggested including\\n\\ninteraction in the selection effect.\\n\\nThe decision to include interaction with stock selection is not arbitrary. If you assume that asset allocation decisions are taken first in a top-down investment process, then the attribution from stock selection can be derived from Quadrant IV minus Quadrant II in Figure 2 and interaction need not be calculated at all.

Obviously, if multiperiod arithmetic excess returns do not add up, then clearly arithmetic attribution that adds up for sin- gle periods will not add up for multiple periods. Value added through active management decisions compounds over time, a fact that should be accounted for in multiperiod frameworks. Naturally, the end users of attribution analy-\\n\\nses expect their analyses to add up without residuals.\\n\\nSolutions can be categorized into two types, smoothing algorithms, such as those described by Carino (1999) and Menchero (2000), and linking algorithms (sometimes described as “dollar attribution”), such as those in GRAP (1997),\\n\\nFrongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede, Foresti, and Matheos (2002).1\\n\\nThe authors of each paper suggested that their method was the most appropriate to implement. Smoothing algorithms, in effect, take the result- ing residual and methodically redistribute it across other factors. Carino (1999) used logarithms, and Menchero (2000) redistributed the residual in an optimised way that minimised the change in any single factor. GRAP (1997), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002) compounded attribution effects through time and achieved identical results, but cru- cially, their methods are order dependent: If the time periods are reversed, the attribution result will change. Frongello acknowledged the order dependence but regarded it as a strength; others, including Laker (2002),\\n\\nwould describe it as a weakness.\\n\\n«\\n\\nDavies and Laker (2001) suggested an “exact” method for using the Brinson model to calculate attributes over multiple periods at a portfolio level, but not sector level. Because of the so-called exact nature of their model, they suggested it would be helpful to evaluate the accuracy of other pro- posed methods by comparison with their method at the total portfolio level. Many articles have been written critiquing and defending existing methods and offering refinements and new methods, including Banchik (2004/2005), Carino (2002), David (2012/2013), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), Jiang and Saenz (2014/2015), Kirievsky and Kirievsky (2000, 2004), Laker (2002, 2005), Menchero (2003), Mirabelli (2000/2001), Reztsov (2011/2012), Spaulding (2002), and Wong (2003/2004, 2007). By and large, however, the end user has proven to be unconcerned about these black box approaches, provided that the multiperiod arithmetic attribution adds up without residu- als. Frongello (2006) concluded that “although the mathematics can differ greatly from one method to another, the story told by the resulting attribution\\n\\nis the same regardless of the method” (p. 366).\\n\\n1Software providers have typically found solutions but often keep their methods more or less proprietary.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Some would suggest that the problem with multiperiod attribution analysis stems from an incorrect definition of excess return itself. Bacon (2002) defined the arithmetic excess return as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the ini- tial value of the portfolio. That work defined the geometric excess return, , as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the final value of the notional fund. In other words, the geo- metric excess return measures the added value in terms of a percentage of the value of the notional fund assets at the end of the period, not the start, which\\n\\nis surely the main concern of any asset owner.\\n\\nBacon (2002) suggested that geometric excess returns are preferable because they are compoundable (geometric excess returns compound over multiple periods without residuals), they are convertible among currencies, and they are proportionate. The preferred definition of excess return should determine the choice of attribution methodology. Bain (1996), Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998), and Bacon (2002) each presented a geometric attribution model. Although developed independently and presented in dif- ferent ways, the models are, in fact, identical, which is an indication of the robustness of the approach.

The difference between Step II and Step I represents the value added by active asset alloca- tion, and the difference between Step III and Step II represents the value added by security selection.

Interestingly, they made the case for geometric attribution in a single-period context, not necessarily a multiperiod one. They also drew a distinction between top-down and bottom-up investment decision processes. A bottom-up investment decision process, they noted, assumes that security\\n\\nselection takes precedence over asset allocation or is performed first.\\n\\nWeber (2018) would consider the Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and Bacon (2002) models to be semi-geometric models. The reason is that although total selection and allocation effects compound to the geometric excess return, the effects within selection and allocation are still arithmeti- cally calculated. Menchero (2001/2002) offered a fully geometric model in\\n\\nwhich individual selection and allocation effects compound through time.\\n\\nMulticurrency Attribution\\n\\nIn this section, we consider three works specifically directed to performance\\n\\nattribution in currency management.\\n\\nAllen (1991). In an article entitled “Performance Attribution for Global Equity Portfolios,” Allen took the Holbrook (1977) concept of successive intermediate portfolios and applied it in a multicurrency environment. Allen stated that the trick to quantifying the impact of each type of active manage- ment decision involved calculating the return on a theoretical portfolio where one type of decision had been neutralised. Comparison of the return on the manager’s portfolio (where no decisions had been neutralised) with the return on the portfolio where a class of management decisions had been neutralised\\n\\nallowed the impact of those neutralised decisions to be measured.\\n\\nWhen carried out correctly, this process is quite neat. No unexplained residuals remain. Allen’s article provides a framework for quantifying the marginal impact that both policy decisions and active management decisions have on the performance of a global equity portfolio. At the heart of this framework is the assumption that the total return on an actively managed\\n\\nglobal equity portfolio is explained by seven types of decisions:\\n\\n1. the choice, at the policy level, of the unhedged dollar-denominated index\\n\\nagainst which the active equity manager is to be measured\\n\\n2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country\\n\\n2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country\\n\\n3. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based\\n\\non the manager’s expectation of the country’s equity returns\\n\\n4. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based\\n\\non the manager’s expectation of the country’s currency returns\\n\\n20\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

This method allows for evaluation of the long-term contribution of a selected\\n\\ninvestment strategy to total return.\\n\\nAnkrim and Hensel (1992, 1994). In 1992, Ankrim and Hensel pub- lished a Russell Research Commentary setting out a framework for multicur- rency performance attribution. This article, building on work by Brinson and Fachler (1985), separated out the impact of currency decisions—in particular, it recognised the significance of differential interest rates in currency decision\\n\\nmaking. Ankrim and Hensel proposed\\n\\na method of performance attribution that retains the simplicity and intui- tive appeal of the Brinson and Fachler approach but breaks the returns from currency into two components: one that recognizes the opportunity cost of returns achievable in forward-currency markets and a second that measures the return attributable to the currency being less than fully hedged, both in the portfolio and in the benchmark with which the portfolio is com-\\n\\npared. (p. 2)\\n\\nIn the 1992 paper, Ankrim and Hensel identified three reasons that\\n\\nincluding currency exposure in performance attribution causes problems:\\n\\nFirst, and most obvious, it alters the returns ultimately received by the cli- ent. In Brinson and Fachler [1985], all returns are denominated in the home currency, but this convention makes it impossible to separate the contribu- tion to returns made by the manager’s country and security selection deci- sions from the impact of currency translation gains and losses.\\n\\nSecond, in practice, many portfolios have some portion (but not necessarily all) of their currency exposure hedged away. This requires an approach to performance attribution that allows the proportion of currency exposure\\n\\nhedged to be variable.\\n\\nThird, even if a portfolio is completely hedged, the client may choose to\\n\\nadopt a benchmark that is less than fully hedged. (p. 2)\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n21\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nThe authors defined two components of currency return: currency surprise and the forward premium. Currency surprise is uncertain, but the forward premium element is not because it depends on interest rate differentials at the\\n\\ntime of purchase:\\n\\nAny approach to multicurrency attribution that lumps the forward premium and currency surprise together will credit positive performance to manag- ers who have large exposures in countries with positive forward premiums. Such an approach would penalize managers who hold large positions in\\n\\ncountries with negative forward premiums. (p. 12)\\n\\nKarnosky and Singer (1994). Arguably the single most important paper published on attribution in the 1990s is Karnosky and Singer. This paper not only demonstrates that managing multicurrency portfolios is sub-optimal if currency is not managed independently but also provides a framework for calculating attribution effects, while critically, taking into account interest rate differentials. Karnosky and Singer resolved the issue of market and currency compounding by using continuously compounded returns in their model, admittedly this is only referred to in the small print, and solved the forward premium concern by thinking in terms of a “return premium” above local interest rates. Karnosky and Singer explained that the term “return premium” is used, rather than the more familiar “risk premium,” to make a subtle distinction in the underlying cash return. “Risk premium” refers to the return of a risky asset in excess of the return of a riskless asset, but in the authors’ analysis, the premiums depend on forward contracts with long maturities, where risk is probably not the dominant factor; hence, the\\n\\nterm “return premium” is used.\\n\\nKarnosky and Singer’s framework demonstrates that separate currency and market strategies can be implemented within a global portfolio in which a specific currency weight is different from the weight of the associated country market. In effect, the authors applied the standard Brinson methodology twice—once to global portfolios by using local-return premiums (rather than simply local returns) to measure allocation and selection effects and, separately, to cash returns in the base currency of the asset owner in order to\\n\\ncalculate independent currency effects, as shown in Figure 7.\\n\\n22\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The type of attribution favoured by the asset manager or asset owner will vary according to the investment decision process, investment objective, quality and availability of data, cost and time considerations, complexity, and reporting objective. Holdings-based and transaction-based attributions are mutually exclusive, and the choice is based on (for holdings based) cost, quality of data, ease of use, and rapid implemen- tation against (for transaction based) the advantages of reconciliation to the client-reported return, completeness, and accuracy. A number of authors— Giguere (2003), Bonafede and McCarthy (2003), Spaulding (2003a), Menchero and Hu (2003), and Bacon (2008)—argued for one approach or another. Spaulding, without an eye to existing software (and thus genuinely independently), concluded that the question “which is better?” does not have a simple answer. Too many variables are at work; in the end, the choice comes down to user preference. In later research, Spaulding (2018) showed that the residual implicit in holdings-based attribution can be extensive and is not nec- essarily correlated with turnover. Both holdings-based and transaction-based attribution are also described as “asset-grouping” or “variance type” attribu- tion, reflecting their requirements for asset allocation data and variance from benchmark data.\\n\\nAttribution Based on Returns. Returns-based attribution, in contrast to the asset-grouping approach, might complement either holdings- or trans- action-based attribution in that it might reveal unexpected biases and make communication easier for asset managers using a factor-focused investment decision process. Returns-based attribution is a direct descendant of Fama (1972) decomposition, which is a single-factor model, via Sharpe (1988) and Fama and French (1993)—both three-factor models that include a general market factor together with a size and value factor—and Carhart (1997), a\\n\\nfour-factor model that introduced a momentum factor.\\n\\nAmenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:\\n\\nAmenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:\\n\\n1. Implicit factor model. In this model, some factor analysis (e.g., a principal components analysis) is performed to statistically extract the factors from\\n\\nthe return’s time series. These factors may not be easily interpretable.\\n\\n2. Explicit macro factor model. In this approach, macroeconomic variables\\n\\nare used as factors.\\n\\n3. Explicit micro factor model. In this approach, microeconomic attributes\\n\\nare used as factors.\\n\\n4. Explicit index factor model. In this approach, stock market indexes\\n\\n(including style subindexes of the market) are used as factors.\\n\\n24\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nWithin this framework, Amenc and Le Sourd (2003) described a wide\\n\\nrange of multifactor models in detail.\\n\\nWilliam F. Sharpe, who is associated with style attribution starting with his 1988 paper (see Sharpe 1988, 1992), used a 12-factor model to determine the passive return of a portfolio with the same style as the active asset man- ager. The difference between the actual portfolio return and the passive return with the same style would be a result of the manager’s selection ability. This type of style analysis provides a natural method for constructing appropriate style benchmarks. Sharpe (1988) stated that the usefulness of the asset-class model depends on the asset classes chosen for implementation. It is desirable that asset classes\\n\\ne be mutually exclusive,\\n\\nbe mutually exclusive,\\n\\ne be exhaustive, and\\n\\nbe exhaustive, and\\n\\ne have returns that differ.\\n\\nhave returns that differ.\\n\\nEach asset class should be proxied by a market capitalization–weighted index of the securities in it, and no security should be included in more than one asset class. Also, the asset classes should have low correlations with each other (or different standard deviations if correlations are high, as is the case in\\n\\nmany fixed-income styles or asset subclasses).\\n\\nSurz (1999/2000) suggested a holdings-based or transaction-based form of style attribution based on the exclusive style characteristics of the hold- ings in the portfolio and benchmark. Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2005) proposed a regression-based attribution system linked to the parameters from the “Fundamental Law of Active Management” (Grinold and Kahn 1995, pp. 117–35). In a slight oversimplification, the fundamental law says that alpha is a function of manager skill as well as breadth (the number of inde- pendent bets made by the manager). The investigation by Clarke et al. (2005) indicated that the “law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression- based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise\\n\\nrelated to constraints in constructing the portfolio” (p. 81).\\n\\nReturns-based or regression-based attribution has the following\\n\\ncharacteristics:\\n\\ne It does not necessarily require the composition of the portfolio.\\n\\nIt does not necessarily require the composition of the portfolio.\\n\\ne It complements traditional holdings- or transaction-based attribution.\\n\\nIt complements traditional holdings- or transaction-based attribution.\\n\\n= It is relatively easy and cost-effective to implement.\\n\\nIt is relatively easy and cost-effective to implement.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Often, this failure occurs because returns are not adjusted for systematic risk and style (high vs. low beta, large vs. small size, value vs. growth orientation, etc.). Simply applying the alloca- tion/selection model often results in attribution results that are not neces- sarily meaningful because they do not reflect the investment process or the risks that drove return over the evaluation period. Risk-adjusted attribution is the real Cinderella of attribution analysis: In practice, risk-adjusted attri- bution is rarely performed. Ankrim (1992) proposed a form of risk-adjusted attribution using beta, as did Bacon (2008) and Obeid (2005). Kophamel (2003), thinking in terms of the volume of “performance cubes” rather than the familiar “performance areas” of the Brinson model, proposed attribution analysis in three dimensions. Spaulding (2016) suggested adjusting for total risk rather than systematic risk—in effect, attributing M2 returns (described in Modigliani 1997).2 Rather satisfactorily, Fisher and D’Alessandro (2019)\\n\\n2Modigliani risk-adjusted performance (also known as M2, M2, the Modigliani–Modigliani measure, or RAP) is a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of some investment portfolio. It measures the returns of the portfolio adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of\\n\\nsome benchmark (e.g., the market).\\n\\n26\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\ntook attribution full circle and tied risk-adjusted attribution back to the origi-\\n\\nnal Fama decomposition.\\n\\nVan Breukelen (2000) suggested a form of risk-adjusted attribution for fixed-income portfolios that takes into account the weighted duration “bets” of portfolio managers. Van Breukelen described a top-down investment deci- sion process in which overall duration is the first decision followed by a mar- ket allocation decision—a combination of country weight and duration—and finally, an issue selection decision within country. Currency effects are mea- sured separately using a Karnosky and Singer (1994) type of approach. The value added by each step of the decision process is measured by using a series\\n\\nof reference or successive notional portfolios.\\n\\nFixed-Income Attribution\\n\\nThe simple Brinson model is widely regarded as being insufficient for all but the simplest of fixed-income investment strategies. McLaren (2002) explained that classical attribution models (e.g., Brinson’s model) are inap- propriate for fixed-income portfolio analysis because the allocation decision in equity models does not explicitly account for yield-curve positioning (dura- tion) set by fixed-income managers. This omission is significant because the duration decision, which has no direct equity counterpart, plays an impor- tant role in the fixed-income decision-making process. Campisi (2000) also explained why fixed income needs its own attribution model and pointed out\\n\\nfive critical differences between stocks and bonds:\\n\\n1. Bonds are temporary lending agreements with a stated maturity, whereas\\n\\nstocks are permanent investments.\\n\\n2. Bonds promise a fixed return, with a strictly defined upside if held to maturity; stocks promise uncertain returns and the unlimited upside (and\\n\\ndownside) associated with ownership.\\n\\n3. Bonds are typically purchased by institutions, which often hold them until maturity. This pattern results in a limited secondary market for bonds. Stock investing takes place in an active secondary market. As a\\n\\nresult, bonds are illiquid compared with stocks.\\n\\n4. Bond performance is driven by promised income and by changes in market yields: When market yields rise above a bond’s stated yield, the price of that bond falls. As a result, the relevant risk for bonds is sensitivity to changes in yields. Stock performance is driven by the market’s economic sectors, and the principal risks for stocks are (a) sensitivity to the overall market, or beta,\\n\\nand (b) the individual fortunes of the company invested in.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n27\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\n5. Bonds are simply the promise of a stream of cash flows; thus, they are relatively homogeneous in their pricing. For example, bonds with the same maturity and default risk will generally sell at the same price. Therefore, bonds reflect little selection effect. Stock prices, in contrast, respond dramatically to company-specific conditions and thus reflect a large selection effect.\\n\\nDistinct approaches for fixed-income attribution emerged quite quickly in the early development of attribution. The method described in Wagner and Tito (1977) is derived directly from Fama decomposition, with beta replaced by a systematic risk measure for bonds—namely, duration. In this approach, fixed-income portfolio performance is driven by promised income and by the\\n\\neffect that changes in yields have on bond prices.\\n\\nNo single, standardised way of defining fixed-income attribution exists. The asset class has more securities than in equity investing, more types of instruments, more variety in investment process, and more quantitative mod- elling requirements. It also has various ways of describing change in the yield curve and a broad array of investment mandates. Murira and Sierra (2006) explained that each of the commercially available systems uses its own partic- ular brand of return attribution. In fact, because of differences in the defini- tion and computation of the factors, different systems often provide different\\n\\nvalues for the same return factor.\\n\\nOther authors have made various contributions to developments in fixed-income attribution—developments often linked to specific invest- ment decision processes or specific software capabilities. These authors include Ramaswamy (2001), Giguere (2005), Colin (2005, 2014), Gillet and Hommolie (2006), Colin, Cubilie, and Bardoux (2006), Silva, de Carvalho,\\n\\nand Ornelas (2010), Simmons and Karadakov (2013/2014), and Dias (2017).\\n\\nFigure 8 illustrates the attribution effects in a typical fixed-income attri- bution model. Here, carry represents the return resulting from the passage of time: coupon payments, accrued interest, and rolling down the yield curve (the\\n\\npull-to-par effect as the instrument approaches maturity).\\n\\nIn Figure 8, the yield-curve factor represents the changing shape of the yield curve, parallel shift (the impact of a parallel move of the yield curve), twist (a change in slope of the yield curve), and curvature (change in the curvature of the yield curve). Often, twist and curvature are combined and\\n\\ndescribed as nonparallel changes in the yield curve or curve reshape.\\n\\nSpread is the return that comes from the widening or narrowing of credit spreads.\\n\\n28\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

This is a nonmanagement effect that is a particular problem for fixed income. The trading effect measures the impact of intraday trading. Currency captures the impact of independent currency management, typically by using a Karnosky\\n\\nand Singer (1994) type of approach.\\n\\nFixed-income attribution models can be characterised as either top-down successive portfolio methods (e.g., Van Breukelen 2000) or bottom-up (yield- curve decomposition) methods. Bottom-up methods calculate the impact of yield-curve movements and credit spreads on individual bonds in both the portfolio and the benchmark and aggregate results.

This decomposi- tion is applied simultaneously to the constituents of the portfolio and to the constituents of the benchmark.

Laker (2001) pointed out that transaction costs— explicit costs (such as brokerage and taxes) and implicit costs (such as the bid–offer spread, market impact, and opportunity cost)—are not dealt with explicitly in most performance attribution methods but are normally included within the stock selection effect. In a bottom-up, security-level attribution approach, Laker suggested using the standard Brinson selection formulas at the security level to calculate the impact of transaction costs (explicit and implicit) and intraday timing effects. He suggested that any return difference between an individual security’s daily return and its return in the index must\\n\\nbe the result of transaction costs and timing within the day.\\n\\nFrequency of Analysis.

Beyond simply observing the attributed returns, he believed, you must be able to judge their statistical significance. He suggested that recommend-\\n\\ning daily observation rests on four fallacies:\\n\\n1. Daily performance is economically meaningful. Not necessarily—for example, information is lost by adjusting for the timing of cash flows in time-weighted returns.\\n\\n2. Daily returns are themselves accurate. Not necessarily—many securities are traded on multiple exchanges or electronic markets at different times, so exactly which closing price is used to compute the daily returns can have a sizable impact. Also, coordinating the timing of corporate actions\\n\\nsuch as dividends, spin-offs, and mergers with index providers is difficult.\\n\\n3. Observations are assumed to be independent. Investment portfolios do not start as a fresh set of management decisions every trading day. Thus the rationale of an independent “start fresh” assumption is weak. Substantial path dependencies are present in portfolio management in practice, which reduces any justification for the assumption of indepen-\\n\\ndent periodic observations of manager skill.\\n\\n4. Parametric distributional assumptions are accurate. Most of the aca- demic literature illustrates that the imperfections of our assumptions with respect to quarterly or monthly return data are small, whereas for daily data, we must consistently reject the correctness of the assumptions. In general, daily security returns have fat-tailed distributions, with large return events occurring far more often than would be consistent with a normal distribution. This issue is less of a problem with quarterly or\\n\\nmonthly returns.\\n\\nDiBartolomeo (2003) concluded that daily performance attribution com- pounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return than attribu- tion using less frequent data—but at a tremendous cost in our ability to judge the statistical significance of the results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in our estimates of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors (believing an estimate is\\n\\nstatistically significant when it is not).\\n\\nDarling and MacDougall (2002/2003) certainly questioned the ben- efits of more frequent and more detailed performance measurement. They suggested that the cost of daily stock-level attribution is difficult to justify\\n\\n(although given recent developments in technology their views may have\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

They suggested that monthly modified Dietz calculations might actually be near the optimum balance and that a simple alternative might be\\n\\nrunning actual profit and loss for each position.3\\n\\nFrongello (2006), in contrast, made the case for daily attribution analysis. He explained that in the real world, risk factor mismatches may occur unin- tentionally—caused by neglect, accidents, or simply changes in the risk pro- file of securities. Performance attribution should seek to explain performance resulting from all risk factor mismatches. Daily attribution is the best method\\n\\nfor monitoring the status and consequence of risk factor mismatches (p. 367).\\n\\nZangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) suggested that daily attribution, if done methodically, should produce results that are superior to monthly attri- bution. They pointed out that regardless of the methodology used, what is ultimately critical is the process governing attribution. The five core compo- nents of what they considered to be a good return attribution process are as\\n\\nfollows:\\n\\n1. Data management and quality control. This task is the most important. Positions, prices, corporate actions, and so on, must be accurately cap-\\n\\ntured, processed, and incorporated.\\n\\n2. Infrastructure. Without proper infrastructure (efficient application of hardware and databases), the chance of errors and delays increases.\\n\\n3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.\\n\\n3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.\\n\\n4. Methods. For example; daily buy-and-hold, monthly buy-and-hold, and\\n\\ntransaction-based attribution.\\n\\n5. Reports. The way in which information is presented is important, so\\n\\ntimely, accurate, and easy-to-understand attribution reports are necessary.\\n\\nZangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) concluded that process plays a criti- cal part in determining the accuracy of attribution results. Return attribution should be based on a process that monitors key input data and evaluates attri-\\n\\nbution results on a daily basis.\\n\\nAttribution of Money-Weighted Return. For purposes of comparative analysis, most attribution analysis is naturally undertaken on time-weighted rates of return (TWR). Attribution analysis of money-weighted rates of return (MWR) is less common. Yet, attribution analysis of MWR is still\\n\\nundertaken in the form of the modified Dietz return calculation method.\\n\\n3The modified Dietz method is a mathematical technique to evaluate a portfolio’s return based on a weighted calculation of its cash flow. The method takes into account the timing of\\n\\ncash flows and assumes a constant rate of return over a specified period of time.\\n\\n32\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nIt was, in fact, recommended by Menchero and Hu (2003) in the context of transaction-based attribution and by Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003). O’Shea and Jeet (2018) suggested single-period attribution of modified Dietz returns for private equity. Spaulding and Campisi (2007) made the case for money-weighted attribution. They suggested that because cash flow move- ments are a factor that defines the investment process, these cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation system instead of\\n\\nbeing neutralised (as occurs in the time-weighted calculation).\\n\\nThe modified Dietz method is a first-order approximation of the internal rate of return (IRR) and, according to Bacon (2007a), an intermediate step in the evolution from calculating IRR (which some might describe as a true MWR) to the true TWR. The IRR is a standard return measure for illiquid asset classes—such as private equity, real estate, and infrastructure—and is common at the total-asset owner level, where comparative analysis is less rel- evant. The modified Dietz method is easy to disaggregate and more straight- forward to attribute than the IRR. Nevertheless, Illmer and Marty (2003) and Illmer (2009) offered a solution to the attribution of the true MWR in terms of both return and profit and loss.\\n\\nD’Alessandro (2016) suggested analysts should end the debate about which method of return to use, TWR or MWR, and require the presentation\\n\\nof both with an attribution between the two.\\n\\nConclusion: The Evolution of Attribution Methodologies\\n\\nThe evolution of attribution analysis is clear, easy to trace, and illustrated in Figure 9, which maps, not necessarily in chronological order, the major\\n\\ndevelopments in attribution analysis discussed in this review.\\n\\nComparative performance measurement starts with the BAI (1968) study, but attribution analysis itself starts with Fama (1972). From that point, a divergence occurs between asset-grouping and variance-type attribution, with the UK SIA (1972) introducing the concept of selection, allocation, and notional portfolios and return-based attribution developed a little later by Sharpe (1992), Fama and French (1993), Carhart (1997), and many others. Fixed-income attribution naturally veers in a different direction via Wagner and Tito (1977), who replaced beta with duration in the Fama decomposition, and Lord (1997), who responded to the investment decision processes of bond\\n\\nmanagers, which are so different from those of equity managers.\\n\\nVery early, a split occurred between, on the one hand, the dominant arithmetic Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson et al. model (1986) and, on the other hand, the total level geometric approach of Holbrook (1977).\\n\\nSmoothing and linking algorithms were soon needed in order for multiperiod\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Algorithms started to be published several years after their initial use in Carino (1999), soon followed by GRAP (1997), Menchero (2000), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002). Allen (1991) is a direct link from Holbrook but addressed multicurrency issues. Burnie et al.

In more recent years, we have seen many variants of yield-curve decomposition models, which reflects the diver- sity of fixed-income investment decision processes.

More clearly described as bottom-up contribution analysis of the portfolio compared with its benchmark, this paper emphasizes the requirement for the attribution to be consistent with the investment strategy of the portfolio manager. Income and price returns are calculated separately. Price return is then attributed according to duration, yield-curve distribution, sector allocation, and issue selection. Shift and twist are considered components of duration return; and sector and specific issuer effects are considered components of spread return. Included also are a calendar return (the price return resulting solely from the passage of time) and a residual return (the difference between the actual return and\\n\\nthe model’s estimate of return).\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The two latter types are as follows: Type 1, which accounts for exter- nal and internal cash flows, and Type 2, which accounts for internal cash flows only. The authors acknowledge that the holdings-based approach will lead to differences between the actual return and the computed return, but they suggest that the magnitude should be small and typically depend on volatility and portfolio turnover. They suggest that this difference should be attributed to trading effects. The authors show that both Type 1 and Type 2 approaches will lead to attribution errors, so they ultimately prefer\\n\\nthe holdings-based approach.\\n\\nMirabelli, Andre. 2000/2001. “The Structure and Visualization of\\n\\nPerformance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (2): 55–80.\\n\\nThis paper proposes an alternative to multiperiod arithmetic performance attribution methods.\\n\\nModigliani, Leah. 1997. “Risk-Adjusted Performance, Part 1: The Time for Risk Measurement Is Now.” Morgan Stanley’s Investment Perspectives\\n\\n(February).\\n\\nThe author introduces the risk-adjusted return measure M2.

The Measurement of Portfolio Performance for Pension Funds.\\n\\nSociety of Investment Analysts.\\n\\nToward the end of 1970, a working group was set up by the UK Society of Investment Analysts to make recommendations on the subject of portfolio performance measurement for pension funds. The resulting report spe- cifically puts forward methods of calculating portfolio performance, thus\\n\\nmaking possible a general comparison of funds.\\n\\nThe approach recommended has two aims: (1) the calculation of a rate of return for comparing funds and (2) the decomposition of the performance of a fund into two components—selection of stocks and selection of sec- tors.

Hensel, Ezra, and Ilkiw (1991) defined attribution as the “mathemati- cal process of explaining an investment return by relating it to the different risk-taking decisions implicit in the portfolio, and the extent to which each of those risks was rewarded or penalized in the capital markets” (p. 66). Colin (2014) said that the purpose of attribution is to disentangle the fund’s overall  return into the component returns generated by each risk.  In other words, attribution measures which of your investment decisions about the portfolio’s underlying risks worked and which did not. This infor- mation is critical business intelligence for anyone involved in selecting, man- aging, or marketing investments. As the authors noted above, Fischer and Wermers (2013) considered attribution analysis to be the “description and the quantification of key factors on the returns of investment portfolios” (p. 395). DiBartolomeo (2003) considered performance attribution to be the process of disentangling component portions of the observed returns to draw conclu-  sions about the strengths and weaknesses of the investment process.  Note that these definitions are similar. The central question of an attribu- tion analysis is thus the following: To which investment decisions can the active  return of a portfolio relative to its benchmark be traced over a given period?  Formally, Bacon (2008) stated that “performance attribution is a tech- nique used to quantify the excess return of a portfolio against its benchmark into the active decisions of the investment decision process” (p. 117). Murira and Sierra (2006) considered performance attribution the ex post complement  to the ex ante risk decomposition provided by the risk measurement process.  “Performance attribution” is, therefore, perhaps a misleading term: As these descriptions suggest, the excess, active, or relative return is examined,  not the whole of the return (or absolute return). “Relative return attribution”  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  1  Performance Attribution  or simply “attribution analysis” is perhaps better terminology. Absolute attri- bution, or simply contribution analysis, would explain the sources of return of a portfolio in isolation rather than in comparison with a benchmark.  As described in Bacon (2008), attribution analysis is a critical manage- ment tool for several key stakeholders in the asset management process. Above all, it is the main tool for performance analysts because it allows them to ensure that the return is correct. It allows them to participate in the invest- ment decision process by enabling them to demonstrably add value and thus justify their salary and effort. Return attribution, together with risk analy- sis, is the tool that allows the analyst to understand the sources of return in the portfolio and to communicate that understanding to portfolio managers,  senior managers, and asset owners.  Investment management firms themselves, and the portfolio managers they employ, are also major users of attribution analysis. Attribution analy- sis provides a good starting point for a dialogue with asset owners on the positive and negative aspects of recent performance. Attribution analysis can be used aggressively to identify underperformance early and provide clients with a thorough explanation of underperformance and, hopefully, a rationale for improving performance. Attribution analysis is also crucial in gaining the confidence of asset owners by demonstrating a good understanding of the  drivers of performance.  Portfolio managers inhabit the front office of asset management firms; typically, performance analysts inhabit the middle office. The back office is also able to use daily, security-level attribution, however, as a diagnostic tool  for identifying pricing and transaction errors.  Bacon (2008) also stated that “senior management take an active interest in attribution analysis to provide them with a tool to monitor their portfolio managers. They will be keen to identify performance outliers—good or bad—  and to ensure that value is added consistently across the firm” (p. 117).  Hence, attribution analysis has numerous uses across a wide range of asset management stakeholders.  Lord (1997) suggested that the characteristics of a good attribution sys-  tem would include the following:  ¢ aconsistent approach for analysing returns,  a consistent approach for analysing returns,  e asolid theoretical framework for valuation,  a solid theoretical framework for valuation,  e the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,  the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,  attribution factors consistent with decision variables of the portfolio strat-  egy process,  2  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  • summary attribution analysis constructed from security details, which  themselves should be available for inspection,  e transactions, and  transactions, and  • robust analytic systems and high-quality data to provide meaningful  attribution results.  Murira and Sierra (2006) suggested that there is general agreement that  an attribution framework must meet two key requirements:  1. It should be consistent with the investment decision-making process of the portfolio. Performance attribution is most useful if it mirrors the investment management process because, in that case, it enables the iden-  tification and explanation of the sources of excess return.  2. It should be compatible with the organization’s performance measurement and risk measurement systems. Managers would have difficulty making effective use of the information provided by the performance attribution process if the data being explained by this process were inconsistent with  the data originating from the internal risk and performance systems.  As in many literature reviews, here the approach to the task is historical— beginning with the first attempts at performance measurement, about a half-  century ago, and progressing to the present.  Early Development  Arguably, comparative performance measurement began with Dietz’s (1966) Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance and the Bank Administration Institute (BAI 1968) report Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison. The purpose of the BAI study was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The main  conclusions of their study are still relevant:  1. Performance measurement returns should be based on market value, not cost.  Returns should be total returns.  wk  2. Returns should be total returns.  Returns should be time weighted. &  3. Returns should be time weighted.  Performance should include risk as well as return.  4. Performance should include risk as well as return.  Funds should be classified according to their investment objectives.  5. Funds should be classified according to their investment objectives.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  3  Performance Attribution  Although the report did not recommend the use of attribution analysis— instead, emphasizing the importance of the total return of the portfolio—it did suggest that comparison of various sector returns within the portfolio might be useful. Interestingly, Eugene Fama was later invited to write and  wrote the chapter on risk for this report.  Fama Decomposition. Fama was the first to fully delve into the sub- ject of attribution analysis, which he did in “Components of Investment Performance” (Fama 1972). In this seminal paper, Fama suggested breaking down observed return into the part resulting from ability to pick the best securities at a given level of risk (which he at the time called “selectivity”; now, it is often referred to as “selection return”) and the part that is the result of predictions of general market price movements—that is, the return from  systematic risk—as follows:  (1)  Excess  Selectivity  Systematic risk  where:  average portfolio return average market or benchmark return portfolio systematic risk  average risk-free rate  If a portfolio is fully diversified, it incurs no specific risk and the total portfolio risk will equal the systematic risk. Portfolio managers will give up diversification, however, to seek additional return. Therefore, the return from selectivity can be broken down into (1) the additional return required to jus- tify sacrificing a given amount of diversification and (2) the net return from selectivity (the remainder of the manager’s value added). The return from  selectivity is equivalent to Jensen’s alpha,  .  The term “diversification” (used in a different context from the one we would understand today) “is the return required to justify moving away from the benchmark and taking on specific risk” (Bacon 2013, p. 88). To calcu- late this diversification return, you first have to calculate the effective beta required such that systematic risk alone is equivalent to the total portfolio  risk. This beta is the Fama beta, calculated as follows:  B.=—, o  4  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  (2)  Performance Attribution  where: where:  6 = portfolio risk  portfolio risk  6, = benchmark risk  benchmark risk  Therefore, the return required to justify not being fully diversified is cal- culated by using the difference between the Fama beta and the portfolio beta  as follows:  d=(B, -B)x(b-7).  @)  (3)  Note that the “Fama beta will always be greater than or equal to the port- folio beta since total risk is greater than or equal to the systematic risk of the  portfolio” (Bacon 2013, p. 89).  The net return from selectivity (“net selectivity,” for short) is the remain- ing return from selectivity after deducting the amount of return required to  justify not being fully diversified:  Net selectivity = Selectivity — Diversification.  Net selectivity = Selectivity – Diversification.  Net selectivity = Sy,, =a—d.  Net selectivity =  If net selectivity is negative, the portfolio manager has failed to justify the  loss of diversification.  Timing is the return from the manager’s variations in systematic risk  (beta) around some policy or target amount:  (4)  where B, = the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  where  the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  Figure 1 illustrates Fama’s decomposition for portfolio A. represents the return from systematic risk (conventional beta) plus the risk-free rate, and  represents the return from the Fama beta plus the risk-free rate.  Fama’s (1972) “Components of Investment Performance” is the first paper to seriously analyse the sources of return of an investment portfolio and,  therefore, represents the birth of attribution analysis.  Notional Funds. In response to the BAI (1968) paper, a working group was set up towards the end of 1970 by the Society of Investment Analysts  (SIA) in the United Kingdom to make recommendations on the subject  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Its approach, eventually published in 1972 (SIA 1972), had two aims: (1) the determination of a standard method of calculating a portfolio’s return, so that funds could be fairly compared, and (2) the decomposition of the performance of the fund into two components—selection of individual stocks and selection of stock sectors. The first aim is achieved by calculating the time-weighted rate of return using a simple approximation (which later became known as the analyst’s test method and ultimately became redundant as more accurate time-weighted returns became available). The second aim, the analysis of performance, is produced by constructing “notional funds” based on market  indexes and comparing them with actual funds.  This early work dealt with equity-market sectors as the macro level of selection and securities within the sectors as the micro level, but common practice now is to regard asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as the macro level and securities within the asset class as the micro level. Thus, our discussion  will proceed from this latter starting point.  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  e a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  e apartly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  a partly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  Note that the actual fund consists of actual returns and actual weights. The fully restrained fund (sometimes called the “fully notional fund”) represents the return on the policy portfolio—that is, the strategic bench-  mark or policy weights set by the asset owner (represented by the pension  6  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Holbrook, in effect, pulled together the BAI (1968) report, Fama’s (1972) decomposition, and the SIA (1972) report. This virtu- ally unknown paper provides the foundation for much of the development in performance analysis that followed. Directing his advice to pension fund  trustees, Holbrook defined the decision-making process as follows:  The practical management of a pension fund investment portfolio involves  decisions at three levels.  i) Policy, i.e. the proportions of the assets which, as a long-term aim, the trustees wish to hold in the different investment mar- kets. The fundamental element of policy is the split between equity-type and fixed-interest investments. Definition of pol- icy may extend to a split of equity-type investments between UK equities, overseas equities and properties, specific pro- portions being set for each. If the trustees are not experts in long-term investment, they will tend to formulate policy in discussion with specialist advisers; it is gratifying to record that actuaries who advise on the financing of pension schemes  are increasingly becoming involved in such discussions.  ii) Strategy, i.e. decisions to depart from the policy proportions in the light of current market conditions, including decisions to hold part of the fund on short-term deposit. The trustees will usually seek advice from experts in the various markets regarding the short-term outlook, up to the time of the next investment meeting and over the next year or so. Except where trustees delegate strategic decisions to managers and advisers, investment meetings are usually held at short regular intervals, and arrangements are made for special meetings whenever it is thought that there has been a material change in market prospects. Often trustees authorize the managers concerned to determine the timing of purchases; thus, a manager is able to retain part of the assets entrusted to him in the form of short- term deposits.  8  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  iii) Selection, i.e. the choice of the particular investments to hold, buy or sell within the various markets. Again, practice varies; many trustees give their managers carte blanche in this area—  some keep close control over day-to-day transactions. (p. 20)  Holbrook went on to describe the trustees’ needs. First, they need to know whether the fund performed well, moderately, or badly. This knowledge requires the calculation of return, comparisons with market returns, and con-  sideration of risk:  The performance of the fund as a whole, and within the different markets and sectors, must be examined separately. Secondly, the trustees need to be advised on the reasons for their fund’s performance; this may be inves- tigated by analysing the results to show contributions to total performance made by policy, strategy, and selection decisions. Finally, the trustees need help in interpreting the results as a guide to future action. Identification of points of strength and weakness in past performance may lead to reconsid- eration of policy and practice, of the decision-making process, and possibly  to a change of manager. (p. 21)  To facilitate the breakdown of returns into policy, strategic, and selection  decisions, Holbrook suggested the return calculation of three notional funds:  based on the model, based on the trustees’ policy proportions, and  based on actual allocations.  Then, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by  Then, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by  (8)  The first factor represents the contribution to total performance resulting from the decision to adopt a policy that differs from the equity and fixed- interest proportions in the model [the industry standard allocation between equity and fixed income at the time]. The second, the contribution from the strategic decision to depart from policy proportions. The third, the contribution from selection decisions for the fixed-interest and equity  sectors taken together. (Holbrook 1977, p. 31)  This passage is the first articulation of successive notional portfolios each of which isolates one step in the investment decision process. The fact that it  was written in 1977 shows how far ahead of his time Holbrook was.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  9  Performance Attribution  Holbrook (1977) linked this successive notional portfolio approach to Fama’s decomposition by equating the first factor to the investor’s return from systematic risk, the second factor to the manager’s return from systematic risk, and the third factor to selectivity.  Foundations  The Brinson Model. The next major development in attribution analysis stems from a series of papers written in the 1980s that collectively describe  Brinson attribution.  Brinson, Hood, and Beebower’s (1986) “Determinants of Portfolio Performance” is perhaps the most well-known paper on attribution. It pro- vided the name for the most common type of equity attribution model used today: the Brinson model. Despite being a relatively short paper, it made two  contributions:  1. The general framework used to decompose total portfolio returns. Brinson et al. (1986) suggested a model for breaking down the arithmetic return in excess of the benchmark (r – b) under the assumption of a standard top-down investment decision process in which the portfolio manager seeks to add value through both timing and security selection. Figure 2 illustrates  their framework for analysing portfolio returns.  Quadrant I represents the policy benchmark return for a period—that is, the return on a hypothetical portfolio wherein the asset-class weights are those in long-term investment policy and the returns are those of the  asset-class benchmarks  .  Quadrant I (9)  Quadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.  Quadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.  In timing, the portfolio manager seeks to add value by holding asset- class (or sector) weights in the portfolio that are different from the asset-class benchmark weights. An asset-class weight in the portfolio that is greater than the benchmark weight for that asset class would be described as overweight and a lesser weight would be described as underweight. Clearly, the portfolio manager will aim to overweight well-performing asset classes (or sectors) and  underweight poorly performing asset classes.  Quadrant II minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-  tracted value from timing only.  10  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.

Quadrant III represents returns resulting from policy and security selec- tion combined. In security selection, the portfolio manager seeks to add value  by selecting individual securities within the asset class or sector.  Quadrant III minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-  tracted value from selection only.  Quadrant IV represents the actual return of the managed portfolio.  Quadrant IV represents the actual return of the managed portfolio.  Brinson et al. (1986) called the remaining term “other” or the “cross-  product” term. It is now more commonly considered to be “interaction.”  Quadrant IV minus Quadrant III minus Quadrant II plus Quadrant I  represents the added or subtracted value from interaction.  2. In a more controversial practice, the framework is used on a sample of pension funds to demonstrate that most of the difference in returns among pension funds is the result of policy decisions, not timing or selection. This  use of the framework is responsible for much of its fame.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  11  Performance Attribution  Attribution Formulas. Brinson et al. (1986) may be the better known of the “Brinson papers,” but the more important paper in terms of the development of attribution is “Measuring Non-US Equity Portfolio Performance” by Brinson and Fachler (1985). Again, it is a short paper, but it documented for the first time the formulas required to calculate individual attribution effects:  n Allocation (Brinson and Fachler [1985] used the term “market selec-  tion”). The contribution to excess return from asset allocation in the ith sector is  A, =(w, -W.)x(b,-6).  n Selection. The contribution to excess return from stock selection in  sector i is  S,=W,x(r,-4).  n Interaction (Brinson and Fachler used the term “cross-product”). The  contribution to excess return from interaction in sector i is  I, =(w;, -W,)x(7,—4;).  With a few modifications, these formulas provide the basic foundations for most of the attribution analysis used today. The terms “asset allocation,” “security selection,” and “interaction” are now universal and familiar to all. At the time, however, allocation might have been described as “timing,” “market selection,” or “weighting.” To establish when the term “allocation” was first used is difficult, but Cocks (1972) was among the first. He defined it as “all those decisions by which the portfolio manager allocates his funds among the selected securities (or broad classes of securities)” (p. 3). Asset allocation spe- cifically locates the decision process in what asset classes to hold and in what weights, and this terminology is associated with Ibbotson and Sinquefield  (1982), although no one knows when the term was first used.  Use of the term “interaction” (or “other” or “cross-product”) is difficult to establish, but certainly, by the early 1990s, “asset allocation,” “security selec-  tion,” and “interaction” had become the most commonly used terms.  The Brinson et al. (1986) paper did not provide a formula for individual attribution effects, but the following variation of the allocation formula is  associated with that paper:  12  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

(13)  (13)  It seems unlikely that Brinson et al. (1986) intended this interpretation, and the Brinson and Fachler (1985) variant for asset allocation is far more common and better aligned with most investment decision processes. If the Brinson et al. definition is used, the contribution from asset allocation will be positive for any overweight sector in which the sector return is positive, but it will be positive when using the Brinson–Fachler definition only if the sector  return exceeds the overall benchmark return.  Graphically, the Brinson et al. (1986) method is easier to illustrate for each sector i than the Brinson and Fachler (1985) method, as shown in Figure 3. The contribution to portfolio return from sector i is the total area , and the contribution from the benchmark alone is area . In this example the total contribution from the portfolio in sector i is greater than the contribution from the benchmark.  The attribution to excess return in sector i is the sum of the areas rep- resenting selection , allocation , and interaction . In this particular example, , and ;  therefore, all three contributions are positive.  The Brinson and Fachler (1985) method illustrated in Figure 4 is a little less intuitive. As stated in Bacon (2008), “We observe no change to the areas representing selection and interaction but allocation is now described by the  area  ” (p. 125).  Figure 3.

The same formulas as those suggested by Brinson–Fachler and associated with Brinson et al. (1986) can be found in a formal discussion response to a paper by Kingston (1973) presented to the Faculty of Actuaries on 14 October 1974, more than 10 years before the  Brinson–Fachler paper was published.  The formulas may well have been developed prior to the publication of the Brinson and Fachler (1985), Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), Brinson, Singer, and Beebower (1991), and Singer (1996) papers, but collectively these papers established attribution analysis as an important aid in the critical review of active strategies and decision-making processes for asset managers,  asset consultants, and asset owners.  Interaction. Interaction is a controversial effect. Most authors—for example, Laker (2001), Spaulding (2003/2004), Campisi (2004b), and Bacon (2008)—would agree that the interaction effect is a directly calculated term, not a residual, but what does it mean? . . . It is certainly not intuitive. As noted, Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), arguably the first definers of the interaction effect, rather unhelpfully described this effect as “other” or a “cross-product”; they did not use the  term “interaction.” By the early 1990s, the term had become fairly universal  14  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  in the literature, however, probably popularised by the software providers of the time. The interaction effect is clearly a cross-product, the combination of allocation and selection decisions.  Laker (2000) suggested “that when calculated properly, the interaction term plays a valuable role in explaining a portfolio’s active performance, and indeed that sometimes it is clearly more explanatory than the other attributes” (p. 43). Spaulding (2003/2004) was more nuanced in his comments, despite pointing out potentially misleading results (from mispriced securities or investing in sectors not in the benchmark). On balance, Spaulding suggested, it is best to calculate interaction, take the time to do some analysis, and then decide where to assign it, or better yet, show the interaction as a separate item and prepare to explain it. Campisi (2004b) and Bacon (2008) were less supportive of using the interaction effect; they suggested that it is not an active part of the investment decision process and, therefore, need not be calculated. Like many asset managers in practice, they suggested including  interaction in the selection effect.  The decision to include interaction with stock selection is not arbitrary. If you assume that asset allocation decisions are taken first in a top-down investment process, then the attribution from stock selection can be derived from Quadrant IV minus Quadrant II in Figure 2 and interaction need not be calculated at all. The decision to include interaction with stock selection is,  therefore, the direct result of the investment decision process.

Multiperiod Analysis  The attribution models described so far work well for single periods with static data. No obvious way exists, however, to combine attribution effects over time. Because of the multiplicative (geometric) nature of returns, arithmetic excess returns fail to add up over multiple periods. Carino (1999, p. 5) eloquently  explained the problem this way:  Over multiple periods, the natural way to combine returns is to compound  them. The compounded return R over t periods is  R=(14r)x(+n) xox (Ltn )-1. [15]  [15]  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  15  Performance Attribution Figure 5.

[16]  [16]  It is clearly unsatisfactory to simply add effects over time, because the sum of return differences does not equal the difference between compounded  returns.  Singer (1996, p. 54) made the same point:  Singer (1996, p. 54) made the same point:  While it is tempting to simply add the individual periods to obtain multipe-  riod attribution results, it is wrong:  [17]  Nor is it satisfactory to compound the single period return differences because  that result does not equal the difference in compounded returns either.

Performance Attribution  Linking and Smoothing. Obviously, if multiperiod arithmetic excess returns do not add up, then clearly arithmetic attribution that adds up for sin- gle periods will not add up for multiple periods. Value added through active management decisions compounds over time, a fact that should be accounted for in multiperiod frameworks. Naturally, the end users of attribution analy-  ses expect their analyses to add up without residuals.  Solutions can be categorized into two types, smoothing algorithms, such as those described by Carino (1999) and Menchero (2000), and linking algorithms (sometimes described as “dollar attribution”), such as those in GRAP (1997),  Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede, Foresti, and Matheos (2002).1  The authors of each paper suggested that their method was the most appropriate to implement. Smoothing algorithms, in effect, take the result- ing residual and methodically redistribute it across other factors. Carino (1999) used logarithms, and Menchero (2000) redistributed the residual in an optimised way that minimised the change in any single factor. GRAP (1997), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002) compounded attribution effects through time and achieved identical results, but cru- cially, their methods are order dependent: If the time periods are reversed, the attribution result will change. Frongello acknowledged the order dependence but regarded it as a strength; others, including Laker (2002),  would describe it as a weakness.  «  Davies and Laker (2001) suggested an “exact” method for using the Brinson model to calculate attributes over multiple periods at a portfolio level, but not sector level. Because of the so-called exact nature of their model, they suggested it would be helpful to evaluate the accuracy of other pro- posed methods by comparison with their method at the total portfolio level. Many articles have been written critiquing and defending existing methods and offering refinements and new methods, including Banchik (2004/2005), Carino (2002), David (2012/2013), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), Jiang and Saenz (2014/2015), Kirievsky and Kirievsky (2000, 2004), Laker (2002, 2005), Menchero (2003), Mirabelli (2000/2001), Reztsov (2011/2012), Spaulding (2002), and Wong (2003/2004, 2007). By and large, however, the end user has proven to be unconcerned about these black box approaches, provided that the multiperiod arithmetic attribution adds up without residu- als. Frongello (2006) concluded that “although the mathematics can differ greatly from one method to another, the story told by the resulting attribution  is the same regardless of the method” (p. 366).  1Software providers have typically found solutions but often keep their methods more or less proprietary.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  17  Performance Attribution  Geometric Attribution. Some would suggest that the problem with multiperiod attribution analysis stems from an incorrect definition of excess return itself. Bacon (2002) defined the arithmetic excess return as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the ini- tial value of the portfolio. That work defined the geometric excess return, , as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the final value of the notional fund. In other words, the geo- metric excess return measures the added value in terms of a percentage of the value of the notional fund assets at the end of the period, not the start, which  is surely the main concern of any asset owner.  Bacon (2002) suggested that geometric excess returns are preferable because they are compoundable (geometric excess returns compound over multiple periods without residuals), they are convertible among currencies, and they are proportionate. The preferred definition of excess return should determine the choice of attribution methodology. Bain (1996), Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998), and Bacon (2002) each presented a geometric attribution model. Although developed independently and presented in dif- ferent ways, the models are, in fact, identical, which is an indication of the robustness of the approach. Geometric models built on the idea of successive notional portfolios can be found in Holbrook (1977), Hymans and Mulligan  (1980), and Allen (1991). As shown in Figure 6, each successive portfolio  Figure 6.

Step I represents the strategic, policy, or benchmark return. The difference between Step II and Step I represents the value added by active asset alloca- tion, and the difference between Step III and Step II represents the value added by security selection. More steps can be introduced for more complex,  multistep investment decision processes.  In the geometric attribution model, the difference between each step is  calculated geometrically:  (19)  Because geometric excess returns compound through time and because geometric allocation effects and geometric selection effects compound together within each period, geometric allocation and geometric selection must also compound through time. Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and  Bacon (2002) provided formulas for individual attribution effects as follows:  n Allocation. The contribution to geometric excess return from asset allocation in the ith sector  is  (20)  n Selection. The contribution to geometric excess return from stock  selection in sector i  is  (21)  or  or  (22)  In geometric attribution, interaction is typically included in the selection effect, although a geometric interaction effect can be derived if desired (see  Weber 2018).  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  19  Performance Attribution  Burnie et al. (1998) described perhaps the most well-known geometric methodology. Interestingly, they made the case for geometric attribution in a single-period context, not necessarily a multiperiod one. They also drew a distinction between top-down and bottom-up investment decision processes. A bottom-up investment decision process, they noted, assumes that security  selection takes precedence over asset allocation or is performed first.  Weber (2018) would consider the Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and Bacon (2002) models to be semi-geometric models. The reason is that although total selection and allocation effects compound to the geometric excess return, the effects within selection and allocation are still arithmeti- cally calculated. Menchero (2001/2002) offered a fully geometric model in  which individual selection and allocation effects compound through time.  Multicurrency Attribution  In this section, we consider three works specifically directed to performance  attribution in currency management.  Allen (1991). In an article entitled “Performance Attribution for Global Equity Portfolios,” Allen took the Holbrook (1977) concept of successive intermediate portfolios and applied it in a multicurrency environment. Allen stated that the trick to quantifying the impact of each type of active manage- ment decision involved calculating the return on a theoretical portfolio where one type of decision had been neutralised. Comparison of the return on the manager’s portfolio (where no decisions had been neutralised) with the return on the portfolio where a class of management decisions had been neutralised  allowed the impact of those neutralised decisions to be measured.  When carried out correctly, this process is quite neat. No unexplained residuals remain. Allen’s article provides a framework for quantifying the marginal impact that both policy decisions and active management decisions have on the performance of a global equity portfolio. At the heart of this framework is the assumption that the total return on an actively managed  global equity portfolio is explained by seven types of decisions:  1. the choice, at the policy level, of the unhedged dollar-denominated index  against which the active equity manager is to be measured  2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country  2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country  3. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based  on the manager’s expectation of the country’s equity returns  4. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based  on the manager’s expectation of the country’s currency returns  20  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  5. the timing of purchases and sales of securities (which implicitly affect the currency appreciation of the portfolio)  6. the choice, at the policy level, of the benchmark percentage of the portfo-  lio that is to be hedged passively against currency fluctuation  7. active decisions in the currency forward markets that cause the portfolio’s  return to deviate from that of the passively hedged benchmark  Allen’s article is noteworthy in that despite being based in the United States where arithmetic attribution prevails, he favored a geometric approach because the attribution factors are computed on a multiplicative basis, so they can be “chain-linked” across any time period to generate a cumulative factor. This method allows for evaluation of the long-term contribution of a selected  investment strategy to total return.  Ankrim and Hensel (1992, 1994). In 1992, Ankrim and Hensel pub- lished a Russell Research Commentary setting out a framework for multicur- rency performance attribution. This article, building on work by Brinson and Fachler (1985), separated out the impact of currency decisions—in particular, it recognised the significance of differential interest rates in currency decision  making. Ankrim and Hensel proposed  a method of performance attribution that retains the simplicity and intui- tive appeal of the Brinson and Fachler approach but breaks the returns from currency into two components: one that recognizes the opportunity cost of returns achievable in forward-currency markets and a second that measures the return attributable to the currency being less than fully hedged, both in the portfolio and in the benchmark with which the portfolio is com-  pared. (p. 2)  In the 1992 paper, Ankrim and Hensel identified three reasons that  including currency exposure in performance attribution causes problems:  First, and most obvious, it alters the returns ultimately received by the cli- ent. In Brinson and Fachler [1985], all returns are denominated in the home currency, but this convention makes it impossible to separate the contribu- tion to returns made by the manager’s country and security selection deci- sions from the impact of currency translation gains and losses.  Second, in practice, many portfolios have some portion (but not necessarily all) of their currency exposure hedged away. This requires an approach to performance attribution that allows the proportion of currency exposure  hedged to be variable.  Third, even if a portfolio is completely hedged, the client may choose to  adopt a benchmark that is less than fully hedged. (p. 2)  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Currency surprise is uncertain, but the forward premium element is not because it depends on interest rate differentials at the  time of purchase:  Any approach to multicurrency attribution that lumps the forward premium and currency surprise together will credit positive performance to manag- ers who have large exposures in countries with positive forward premiums. Such an approach would penalize managers who hold large positions in  countries with negative forward premiums. (p. 12)  Karnosky and Singer (1994). Arguably the single most important paper published on attribution in the 1990s is Karnosky and Singer. This paper not only demonstrates that managing multicurrency portfolios is sub-optimal if currency is not managed independently but also provides a framework for calculating attribution effects, while critically, taking into account interest rate differentials. Karnosky and Singer resolved the issue of market and currency compounding by using continuously compounded returns in their model, admittedly this is only referred to in the small print, and solved the forward premium concern by thinking in terms of a “return premium” above local interest rates. Karnosky and Singer explained that the term “return premium” is used, rather than the more familiar “risk premium,” to make a subtle distinction in the underlying cash return. “Risk premium” refers to the return of a risky asset in excess of the return of a riskless asset, but in the authors’ analysis, the premiums depend on forward contracts with long maturities, where risk is probably not the dominant factor; hence, the  term “return premium” is used.  Karnosky and Singer’s framework demonstrates that separate currency and market strategies can be implemented within a global portfolio in which a specific currency weight is different from the weight of the associated country market. In effect, the authors applied the standard Brinson methodology twice—once to global portfolios by using local-return premiums (rather than simply local returns) to measure allocation and selection effects and, separately, to cash returns in the base currency of the asset owner in order to  calculate independent currency effects, as shown in Figure 7.  22  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The multifactor model is a regression equation that describes the way a particular security or portfolio reacts to industry sec-  tor, fundamental, macroeconomic, and other market factors.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  23  Performance Attribution  Asset-Grouping Attribution. The type of attribution favoured by the asset manager or asset owner will vary according to the investment decision process, investment objective, quality and availability of data, cost and time considerations, complexity, and reporting objective. Holdings-based and transaction-based attributions are mutually exclusive, and the choice is based on (for holdings based) cost, quality of data, ease of use, and rapid implemen- tation against (for transaction based) the advantages of reconciliation to the client-reported return, completeness, and accuracy. A number of authors— Giguere (2003), Bonafede and McCarthy (2003), Spaulding (2003a), Menchero and Hu (2003), and Bacon (2008)—argued for one approach or another. Spaulding, without an eye to existing software (and thus genuinely independently), concluded that the question “which is better?” does not have a simple answer. Too many variables are at work; in the end, the choice comes down to user preference. In later research, Spaulding (2018) showed that the residual implicit in holdings-based attribution can be extensive and is not nec- essarily correlated with turnover. Both holdings-based and transaction-based attribution are also described as “asset-grouping” or “variance type” attribu- tion, reflecting their requirements for asset allocation data and variance from benchmark data.  Attribution Based on Returns. Returns-based attribution, in contrast to the asset-grouping approach, might complement either holdings- or trans- action-based attribution in that it might reveal unexpected biases and make communication easier for asset managers using a factor-focused investment decision process. Returns-based attribution is a direct descendant of Fama (1972) decomposition, which is a single-factor model, via Sharpe (1988) and Fama and French (1993)—both three-factor models that include a general market factor together with a size and value factor—and Carhart (1997), a  four-factor model that introduced a momentum factor.  Amenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:  Amenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:  1. Implicit factor model. In this model, some factor analysis (e.g., a principal components analysis) is performed to statistically extract the factors from  the return’s time series. These factors may not be easily interpretable.  2. Explicit macro factor model. In this approach, macroeconomic variables  are used as factors.  3. Explicit micro factor model. In this approach, microeconomic attributes  are used as factors.  4. Explicit index factor model. In this approach, stock market indexes  (including style subindexes of the market) are used as factors.  24  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Within this framework, Amenc and Le Sourd (2003) described a wide  range of multifactor models in detail.  William F. Sharpe, who is associated with style attribution starting with his 1988 paper (see Sharpe 1988, 1992), used a 12-factor model to determine the passive return of a portfolio with the same style as the active asset man- ager. The difference between the actual portfolio return and the passive return with the same style would be a result of the manager’s selection ability. This type of style analysis provides a natural method for constructing appropriate style benchmarks. Sharpe (1988) stated that the usefulness of the asset-class model depends on the asset classes chosen for implementation. It is desirable that asset classes  e be mutually exclusive,  be mutually exclusive,  e be exhaustive, and  be exhaustive, and  e have returns that differ.  have returns that differ.  Each asset class should be proxied by a market capitalization–weighted index of the securities in it, and no security should be included in more than one asset class. Also, the asset classes should have low correlations with each other (or different standard deviations if correlations are high, as is the case in  many fixed-income styles or asset subclasses).  Surz (1999/2000) suggested a holdings-based or transaction-based form of style attribution based on the exclusive style characteristics of the hold- ings in the portfolio and benchmark. Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2005) proposed a regression-based attribution system linked to the parameters from the “Fundamental Law of Active Management” (Grinold and Kahn 1995, pp. 117–35). In a slight oversimplification, the fundamental law says that alpha is a function of manager skill as well as breadth (the number of inde- pendent bets made by the manager). The investigation by Clarke et al. (2005) indicated that the “law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression- based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise  related to constraints in constructing the portfolio” (p. 81).  Returns-based or regression-based attribution has the following  characteristics:  e It does not necessarily require the composition of the portfolio.

Risk-Adjusted Attribution  Campisi (2000) listed the characteristics of a good performance attribution  system as follows:  • It is consistent with the investment process and the manager’s decision-  making process.  • It uses a benchmark that reflects the manager’s strategic (long-term) asset  allocation.  e It measures the effect of the manager’s tactical (short-term) allocation shifts.  It measures the effect of the manager’s tactical (short-term) allocation shifts.  e It adjusts attribution of return for systematic risk(s).  It adjusts attribution of return for systematic risk(s).  Campisi (2000) suggested that many attribution systems fail at least one of these criteria and some fail all of them. Often, this failure occurs because returns are not adjusted for systematic risk and style (high vs. low beta, large vs. small size, value vs. growth orientation, etc.). Simply applying the alloca- tion/selection model often results in attribution results that are not neces- sarily meaningful because they do not reflect the investment process or the risks that drove return over the evaluation period. Risk-adjusted attribution is the real Cinderella of attribution analysis: In practice, risk-adjusted attri- bution is rarely performed. Ankrim (1992) proposed a form of risk-adjusted attribution using beta, as did Bacon (2008) and Obeid (2005). Kophamel (2003), thinking in terms of the volume of “performance cubes” rather than the familiar “performance areas” of the Brinson model, proposed attribution analysis in three dimensions. Spaulding (2016) suggested adjusting for total risk rather than systematic risk—in effect, attributing M2 returns (described in Modigliani 1997).2 Rather satisfactorily, Fisher and D’Alessandro (2019)  2Modigliani risk-adjusted performance (also known as M2, M2, the Modigliani–Modigliani measure, or RAP) is a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of some investment portfolio. It measures the returns of the portfolio adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of  some benchmark (e.g., the market).  26  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  took attribution full circle and tied risk-adjusted attribution back to the origi-  nal Fama decomposition.  Van Breukelen (2000) suggested a form of risk-adjusted attribution for fixed-income portfolios that takes into account the weighted duration “bets” of portfolio managers. Van Breukelen described a top-down investment deci- sion process in which overall duration is the first decision followed by a mar- ket allocation decision—a combination of country weight and duration—and finally, an issue selection decision within country. Currency effects are mea- sured separately using a Karnosky and Singer (1994) type of approach. The value added by each step of the decision process is measured by using a series  of reference or successive notional portfolios.  Fixed-Income Attribution  The simple Brinson model is widely regarded as being insufficient for all but the simplest of fixed-income investment strategies. McLaren (2002) explained that classical attribution models (e.g., Brinson’s model) are inap- propriate for fixed-income portfolio analysis because the allocation decision in equity models does not explicitly account for yield-curve positioning (dura- tion) set by fixed-income managers. This omission is significant because the duration decision, which has no direct equity counterpart, plays an impor- tant role in the fixed-income decision-making process. Campisi (2000) also explained why fixed income needs its own attribution model and pointed out  five critical differences between stocks and bonds:  1. Bonds are temporary lending agreements with a stated maturity, whereas  stocks are permanent investments.  2. Bonds promise a fixed return, with a strictly defined upside if held to maturity; stocks promise uncertain returns and the unlimited upside (and  downside) associated with ownership.  3. Bonds are typically purchased by institutions, which often hold them until maturity. This pattern results in a limited secondary market for bonds. Stock investing takes place in an active secondary market. As a  result, bonds are illiquid compared with stocks.  4. Bond performance is driven by promised income and by changes in market yields: When market yields rise above a bond’s stated yield, the price of that bond falls. As a result, the relevant risk for bonds is sensitivity to changes in yields. Stock performance is driven by the market’s economic sectors, and the principal risks for stocks are (a) sensitivity to the overall market, or beta,  and (b) the individual fortunes of the company invested in.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  27  Performance Attribution  5. Bonds are simply the promise of a stream of cash flows; thus, they are relatively homogeneous in their pricing. For example, bonds with the same maturity and default risk will generally sell at the same price. Therefore, bonds reflect little selection effect. Stock prices, in contrast, respond dramatically to company-specific conditions and thus reflect a large selection effect.  Distinct approaches for fixed-income attribution emerged quite quickly in the early development of attribution. The method described in Wagner and Tito (1977) is derived directly from Fama decomposition, with beta replaced by a systematic risk measure for bonds—namely, duration. In this approach, fixed-income portfolio performance is driven by promised income and by the  effect that changes in yields have on bond prices.  No single, standardised way of defining fixed-income attribution exists. The asset class has more securities than in equity investing, more types of instruments, more variety in investment process, and more quantitative mod- elling requirements. It also has various ways of describing change in the yield curve and a broad array of investment mandates. Murira and Sierra (2006) explained that each of the commercially available systems uses its own partic- ular brand of return attribution. In fact, because of differences in the defini- tion and computation of the factors, different systems often provide different  values for the same return factor.  Other authors have made various contributions to developments in fixed-income attribution—developments often linked to specific invest- ment decision processes or specific software capabilities. These authors include Ramaswamy (2001), Giguere (2005), Colin (2005, 2014), Gillet and Hommolie (2006), Colin, Cubilie, and Bardoux (2006), Silva, de Carvalho,  and Ornelas (2010), Simmons and Karadakov (2013/2014), and Dias (2017).  Figure 8 illustrates the attribution effects in a typical fixed-income attri- bution model. Here, carry represents the return resulting from the passage of time: coupon payments, accrued interest, and rolling down the yield curve (the  pull-to-par effect as the instrument approaches maturity).  In Figure 8, the yield-curve factor represents the changing shape of the yield curve, parallel shift (the impact of a parallel move of the yield curve), twist (a change in slope of the yield curve), and curvature (change in the curvature of the yield curve). Often, twist and curvature are combined and  described as nonparallel changes in the yield curve or curve reshape.  Spread is the return that comes from the widening or narrowing of credit spreads.  28  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Figure 8.

Source: Redrawn from a diagram in Dai and Elliot (2014/2015).  Selection effects include convexity, any optionality in the payment of future coupons (important with mortgage-backed securities because mortgages can be prepaid), and a residual. Normally quite small, residuals are classified by Dias (2017) as caused by the model or caused by data errors and systematic or  random effects.  In the other category, the price effect captures the difference in price sources between the bonds in the portfolio and bonds in the benchmark. This is a nonmanagement effect that is a particular problem for fixed income. The trading effect measures the impact of intraday trading. Currency captures the impact of independent currency management, typically by using a Karnosky  and Singer (1994) type of approach.  Fixed-income attribution models can be characterised as either top-down successive portfolio methods (e.g., Van Breukelen 2000) or bottom-up (yield- curve decomposition) methods. Bottom-up methods calculate the impact of yield-curve movements and credit spreads on individual bonds in both the portfolio and the benchmark and aggregate results. Top-down models are perhaps easier to implement and more effective in terms of communicating to  asset owners and other stakeholders.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  29  Performance Attribution  Gillet and Hommolie (2006) described the bottom-up approach as a suc- cessive spread methodology that can be split into two phases. The first phase consists of decomposing the bond prices into its various characteristics (pas- sage of time, evolution of yield curves, variation of spreads). This decomposi- tion is applied simultaneously to the constituents of the portfolio and to the constituents of the benchmark. The second phase consists only of regrouping the separated elements according to the investment decision process (p. 65). Bottom-up models are more difficult and expensive to implement but more  appropriate to the detailed investment decision processes of the front office.  McLaren (2002) offered a geometric fixed-income attribution model, which is not common. Most fixed-income attribution models are arithme- tic in nature, although for the most part, they can be adapted for geometric analysis. The reason may be that excess returns are typically smaller than in equity investing and the underlying benchmark returns less volatile, mak- ing the difference between geometric and arithmetic excess return smaller in magnitude.

Transaction Costs. Laker (2001) pointed out that transaction costs— explicit costs (such as brokerage and taxes) and implicit costs (such as the bid–offer spread, market impact, and opportunity cost)—are not dealt with explicitly in most performance attribution methods but are normally included within the stock selection effect. In a bottom-up, security-level attribution approach, Laker suggested using the standard Brinson selection formulas at the security level to calculate the impact of transaction costs (explicit and implicit) and intraday timing effects. He suggested that any return difference between an individual security’s daily return and its return in the index must  be the result of transaction costs and timing within the day.  Frequency of Analysis. DiBartolomeo (2003) challenged the assump-  tion that aggregated daily attribution analysis is more appropriate than  30  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  monthly aggregated analysis and suggested that applying typical attribution methods to daily data draws on assumptions that are highly biased and unre- liable. Beyond simply observing the attributed returns, he believed, you must be able to judge their statistical significance. He suggested that recommend-  ing daily observation rests on four fallacies:  1. Daily performance is economically meaningful. Not necessarily—for example, information is lost by adjusting for the timing of cash flows in time-weighted returns.  2. Daily returns are themselves accurate. Not necessarily—many securities are traded on multiple exchanges or electronic markets at different times, so exactly which closing price is used to compute the daily returns can have a sizable impact. Also, coordinating the timing of corporate actions  such as dividends, spin-offs, and mergers with index providers is difficult.  3. Observations are assumed to be independent. Investment portfolios do not start as a fresh set of management decisions every trading day. Thus the rationale of an independent “start fresh” assumption is weak. Substantial path dependencies are present in portfolio management in practice, which reduces any justification for the assumption of indepen-  dent periodic observations of manager skill.  4. Parametric distributional assumptions are accurate. Most of the aca- demic literature illustrates that the imperfections of our assumptions with respect to quarterly or monthly return data are small, whereas for daily data, we must consistently reject the correctness of the assumptions. In general, daily security returns have fat-tailed distributions, with large return events occurring far more often than would be consistent with a normal distribution. This issue is less of a problem with quarterly or  monthly returns.  DiBartolomeo (2003) concluded that daily performance attribution com- pounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return than attribu- tion using less frequent data—but at a tremendous cost in our ability to judge the statistical significance of the results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in our estimates of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors (believing an estimate is  statistically significant when it is not).  Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003) certainly questioned the ben- efits of more frequent and more detailed performance measurement. They suggested that the cost of daily stock-level attribution is difficult to justify  (although given recent developments in technology their views may have  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

They suggested that monthly modified Dietz calculations might actually be near the optimum balance and that a simple alternative might be  running actual profit and loss for each position.3  Frongello (2006), in contrast, made the case for daily attribution analysis. He explained that in the real world, risk factor mismatches may occur unin- tentionally—caused by neglect, accidents, or simply changes in the risk pro- file of securities. Performance attribution should seek to explain performance resulting from all risk factor mismatches. Daily attribution is the best method  for monitoring the status and consequence of risk factor mismatches (p. 367).  Zangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) suggested that daily attribution, if done methodically, should produce results that are superior to monthly attri- bution. They pointed out that regardless of the methodology used, what is ultimately critical is the process governing attribution. The five core compo- nents of what they considered to be a good return attribution process are as  follows:  1. Data management and quality control. This task is the most important. Positions, prices, corporate actions, and so on, must be accurately cap-  tured, processed, and incorporated.  2. Infrastructure. Without proper infrastructure (efficient application of hardware and databases), the chance of errors and delays increases.  3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.  3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.  4. Methods. For example; daily buy-and-hold, monthly buy-and-hold, and  transaction-based attribution.  5. Reports. The way in which information is presented is important, so  timely, accurate, and easy-to-understand attribution reports are necessary.  Zangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) concluded that process plays a criti- cal part in determining the accuracy of attribution results. Return attribution should be based on a process that monitors key input data and evaluates attri-  bution results on a daily basis.  Attribution of Money-Weighted Return. For purposes of comparative analysis, most attribution analysis is naturally undertaken on time-weighted rates of return (TWR). Attribution analysis of money-weighted rates of return (MWR) is less common. Yet, attribution analysis of MWR is still  undertaken in the form of the modified Dietz return calculation method.  3The modified Dietz method is a mathematical technique to evaluate a portfolio’s return based on a weighted calculation of its cash flow. The method takes into account the timing of  cash flows and assumes a constant rate of return over a specified period of time.  32  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  It was, in fact, recommended by Menchero and Hu (2003) in the context of transaction-based attribution and by Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003). O’Shea and Jeet (2018) suggested single-period attribution of modified Dietz returns for private equity. Spaulding and Campisi (2007) made the case for money-weighted attribution. They suggested that because cash flow move- ments are a factor that defines the investment process, these cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation system instead of  being neutralised (as occurs in the time-weighted calculation).  The modified Dietz method is a first-order approximation of the internal rate of return (IRR) and, according to Bacon (2007a), an intermediate step in the evolution from calculating IRR (which some might describe as a true MWR) to the true TWR. The IRR is a standard return measure for illiquid asset classes—such as private equity, real estate, and infrastructure—and is common at the total-asset owner level, where comparative analysis is less rel- evant. The modified Dietz method is easy to disaggregate and more straight- forward to attribute than the IRR. Nevertheless, Illmer and Marty (2003) and Illmer (2009) offered a solution to the attribution of the true MWR in terms of both return and profit and loss.  D’Alessandro (2016) suggested analysts should end the debate about which method of return to use, TWR or MWR, and require the presentation  of both with an attribution between the two.  Conclusion: The Evolution of Attribution Methodologies  The evolution of attribution analysis is clear, easy to trace, and illustrated in Figure 9, which maps, not necessarily in chronological order, the major  developments in attribution analysis discussed in this review.  Comparative performance measurement starts with the BAI (1968) study, but attribution analysis itself starts with Fama (1972). From that point, a divergence occurs between asset-grouping and variance-type attribution, with the UK SIA (1972) introducing the concept of selection, allocation, and notional portfolios and return-based attribution developed a little later by Sharpe (1992), Fama and French (1993), Carhart (1997), and many others. Fixed-income attribution naturally veers in a different direction via Wagner and Tito (1977), who replaced beta with duration in the Fama decomposition, and Lord (1997), who responded to the investment decision processes of bond  managers, which are so different from those of equity managers.  Very early, a split occurred between, on the one hand, the dominant arithmetic Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson et al. model (1986) and, on the other hand, the total level geometric approach of Holbrook (1977).

Allen (1991) is a direct link from Holbrook but addressed multicurrency issues. Burnie et al.

Performance Attribution  Hensel (1992) and, with more success, Karnosky and Singer (1994) adapted the basic Brinson model for multicurrency attribution, including, importantly, taking into account interest rate differentials. Van Breukelen (2000) adapted  the Brinson model for successive portfolio fixed-income attribution.  Figure 9 firmly cements Brinson and Fachler (1985) at the centre of developments in attribution analysis. In more recent years, we have seen many variants of yield-curve decomposition models, which reflects the diver- sity of fixed-income investment decision processes. Because of low uptake, risk-adjusted attribution is not illustrated here but could be represented by a  link between return-based methods and the Brinson model.

This article provides a framework for quantifying the marginal impact that both policy decisions and active management decisions have on the per- formance of a global equity portfolio. The article is noteworthy because, influenced by currency effects, it represents an early US-based example of geometric or multiplicative attribution; it emphasises the value of “no  unexplained residuals” and attribution factors that “chain-link.”  Amenc, Noel, and Veronique Le Sourd. 2003. Portfolio Theory and Performance Analysis. John Wiley & Sons.  This wide-ranging academic work evaluating the quality of the portfolio management process connects each of the major categories of techniques and practices to the unifying and seminal conceptual developments of modern portfolio theory. Of particular relevance to attribution analysis is Chapter 6 on multifactor models and their application to performance measurement, Chapter 7 on evaluating the investment management pro- cess and decomposing performance, and Chapter 8 on fixed-income secu-  rity investment.  Amenc, Noel, Daphne Sfeir, and Lionel Martellini. 2003. “An Integrated Framework for Style Analysis and Performance Measurement.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 7 (4): 35–41.  This article explains that risk-adjusted performance evaluation consists of using a factor model to compare the overall performance of a manager with the “normal” performance the manager would get from being exposed to  rewarded sources of risk. The article suggests the use of two important  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Ankrim, Ernest M. 1992. “Risk-Adjusted Performance Attribution.”  Financial Analysts Journal 48 (2): 75–82.  The author suggests that classical attribution analysis does not consider risk and posits that in general, such methods will tend to overreward risky managers and underreward conservative ones. The author proposes an  attribution approach that adjusts for the systematic risk of each sector.  Ankrim, Ernest M., and Chris R.

The author explains that the choice of an arithmetic or geometric attribution method is really a choice between using arithmetic or geometric excess return, and he expresses a preference for geometric excess returns based on compoundability, convertibility, and proportionality. Finally, the author presents a geometric attribution model that, although developed indepen-  dently, is actually identical to that of Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998).

The author illustrates and explains the evolution of return calculations from internal rates of return to true time-weighted rates of return. In summary, the author suggests that time-weighted forms of attribution will remain  dominant because of the following:  • The time-weighted rate of return is most appropriate for comparisons  of managers.  36  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the  Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison. Bank Administration Institute.  The purpose of the BAI study, the starting point for performance analysis, was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds in order to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The report recommended, among other things, the use of market value, not book  value; total return; time-weighted rates of return; and taking risk into account.  Bain, William G. 1996. Investment Performance Measurement. Woodhead Publishing.  This book is, for the most part, concerned with the measurement and anal- ysis of pension fund investment portfolios. Most notable is its description of the WM Company’s multiplicative (or geometric) attribution methodol-  ogy (pp. 65–74).  Banchik, Sean. 2004/2005. “Pure and Inter-Period Interaction Effects in  Multi-Period Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 9 (2): 53–63.  The author concludes that there is no single correct way to link single- period arithmetic effects to produce multiperiod effects. The appropriate methodology is generally one of personal preference. The most relevant question for the reader is not which method is correct but whether the reader  understands where these effects are included in the chosen methodology.  Bonafede, Julia K., Steven J. Foresti, and Peter Matheos. 2002. “A Multi- Period Linking Algorithm That Has Stood the Test of Time.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 7 (1): 15–26.

Only buy-and-hold returns are consistent with benchmarking needs; therefore, performance attribution for portfolio management should use holdings-based return analysis. The authors propose an additional term called “trading” to explain the  difference.  Brinson, Gary P., and Nimrod Fachler. 1985. “Measuring Non-US Equity  Portfolio Performance.” Journal of Portfolio Management 11 (3): 73–76.  This hugely important paper documented, for the first time, selection and allocation formulas at the sector level. The paper helped lend “Brinson” to the name of the most commonly used attribution model.  Brinson, Gary P., L. Randolph Hood, Jr., and Gilbert L. Beebower. 1986. “Determinants of Portfolio Performance.” Financial Analysts Journal 42 (4):  39–44.  This extremely well-known paper is important for two reasons. First, it provided the general framework for the decomposition of portfolio return into selection, allocation, and interaction effects (although this last piece is described as “other” in the paper). Second, and more controversially, the paper made the observation that policy decisions make by far the biggest  contribution to the differences in returns among pension funds.  Brinson, Gary P., Brian D. Singer, and Gilbert L. Beebower. 1991. “Determinants of Portfolio Performance II: An Update.” Financial Analysts  Journal 47 (3): 40–48.

Teder. 1998. “Arithmetic and Geometric Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement  3 (1): 59–68.  Most attribution models are arithmetically formulated and measure the manager’s “value added”—or the difference between a fund’s return and a passive benchmark return. The authors of this paper contended that such models are prone to error and may produce inconclusive results. This paper illustrates the benefits of using geometric attribution, which defines the “management effect” as the ratio of the fund return factor to the bench-  mark return factor.  This paper is of fundamental importance in addressing the relative advan-  tage of geometric over arithmetic attribution, multiperiod attribution, and  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Campisi, Stephen. 2000. “Primer on Fixed Income Performance Attribution.”  Journal of Performance Measurement 4 (4): 14–25.  The author explains that the drivers of fixed-income performance are fun- damentally different from those of equity portfolios. Bond portfolio per- formance is driven by promised income and by the effect that changes in yields have on bond prices. The author proposes a simple attribution model that provides a straightforward method for identifying the systematic risk and stylistic factors of the asset manager’s strategy.  Campisi, Stephen. 2004a. “The Case for Money-Weighted Performance  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (3): 31–41.  The proposal in this paper is that although the case is irrefutable for accept- ing the time-weighted return as the preferred method for measuring the return of an asset manager, an equally compelling case can be made for accepting the money-weighted return as the appropriate method for evalu- ating the source of that active return; that is, the money-weighted return is  the correct method for performance attribution.  Campisi, Stephen. 2004b. “Debunking the Interaction Myth.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 8 (4): 63–70.  The author refutes the idea of “interaction” and demonstrates that interac- tion arises from either a poor attribution model or a poor implementation of a sound attribution model. When a sound attribution model is imple- mented correctly, the interaction effect is eliminated. Despite the appearance of mathematical rigor in the calculation of interaction, investors and clients  understand that interaction is not a legitimate part of the investment process.

Canty, Mike. 2017/2018. “Evolving Performance Attribution to Support Exploratory Excess Return Decomposition.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 22 (2): 27–38.  The author proposes three ways to improve arithmetic performance attri-  bution. First, the total weight associated with the stock selection effect  40  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Second, the assessment of an asset allocation decision should consider the actual returns connected to that decision. Third, excess return decomposition should exclude the  impact of overlapping issue-level positions.  Carhart, Mark M. 1997. “On Persistence in Mutual Fund Performance.” Journal of Finance 52 (1): 57–82.  In this highly influential paper, the author proposes an extension to the  Fama–French (1993) three-factor model by adding a momentum factor.  Carino, David R. 1999. “Combining Attribution Effects over Time.” Journal  of Performance Measurement 3 (4): 5–14.  This paper discloses Frank Russell Company’s method of combining attribution effects over time and displaying results in an additive man- ner. The paper is important in that it is the first time a software firm pub- lished its method for linking multiple-period attribution results without residuals, thus encouraging other firms to publish their in-house linking  methodologies.  Carino, David R. 2002. “Refinements in Multi-Period Attribution.” Journal  of Performance Measurement 7 (1): 45–53.  The author offers a derivation of the dollar family of linking algorithms (see Frongello 2002a, 2002b; GRAP 1997; and Bonafede, Foresti, and Matheos 2002) and discusses further refinements whilst cautioning the  performance analyst to balance complexity against practicality.  Clarke, Roger, Harindra de Silva, and Steven Thorley. 2005. “Performance  Attribution and the Fundamental Law.” Financial Analysts Journal 61 (5): 70–83.  The authors propose a regression-based attribution system linked to the parameters from the “Fundamental Law of Active Management” (Grinold and Kahn 1995). Their investigation indicates that the law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression-based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise related to constraints in  constructing the portfolio.

The objective of performance analysis should be to measure the various elements of performance that reflect the decisions involved in the investment process. The author then suggests that investment decisions may be classified in two ways: selection and allocation. This paper is one of  the first to use the term “allocation.”  Colin, Andrew M. 2005.

Colin, Andrew M., Mathieu Cubilie, and Frederic Bardoux. 2006. “A New Approach to the Decomposition of Yield Curve Movements for Fixed Income  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 10 (4): 18–28.  The authors discuss the most common ways to describe yield-curve movements: shift, twist, and curvature. Shift is a parallel movement of the curve across all maturities. Twist is a steepening or flattening of the curve, and curvature occurs when a curve becomes more or less humped. The authors suggest an approach to decomposing curve changes that cir- cumvents the difficulties inherent in principal components analysis and  model fitting.  Dai, Tianci, and Mark Elliot. 2014/2015. “Fixed Income Attribution with  Carry Effect.” Journal of Performance Measurement 19 (2): 7–18.  These authors propose a way to capture the true carry return. Typical fixed- income return decompositions attempt to include the carry return, but the return is usually (inadequately) approximated by yield. The authors argue that using an accurate calculation better isolates the effects of yield-curve  shifts, shape, and position; spread changes; and other factors.  42  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

DiBartolomeo, Dan. 2003. “Just Because We Can Doesn’t Mean We Should.”  Journal of Performance Measurement 7 (3): 30–36.  This paper presents four fallacies about daily observation and concludes that daily performance attribution compounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return but at a tremendous cost in the analyst’s ability to judge the statistical significance of results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in estimates  of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors.  Dietz, Peter O. 1966.

Fama suggests finer breakdowns of performance than given by the Sharpe, Treynor, or Jensen. For example, methods are presented for distinguishing, on the one hand, the part of an observed return that results from ability to pick the best securities of a given level of risk (“selectivity”) from, on the other hand, the part that is a result of predictions of general market price movements (“timing”). The author also suggests methods for measuring the effects of forgone diversification when an investment manager decides to concentrate  the portfolio’s holdings in what the manager thinks are a few “winners.”  44  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The ben- efit is that it allows analysts to decompose the excess portfolio return into components of risk allocation, selection, and net selectivity that are addi-  tive and consistent with financial theory.

The author provides reflections on a group of practitioners whose objectives were to review the theoretical and methodological aspects of fixed-income attribution and to define best practices. In the context of fixed income, this  group agreed to the following:  • Excess return is generally low; therefore, methodologies must be accu-  rate with small residuals.  The attribution results must match the investment decision process.  • The price differential between the portfolio and the benchmark is not  an effect attributable to the manager.  • The calculation frequency should be as high as possible to avoid distortion.  The group described two types of attribution:  1. Yield-curve decomposition, which breaks down performance into passage of time, yield-curve movements (however described), and spread  variations. This analysis is mostly intended for portfolio managers.  46  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  2. Exposure decomposition, a top-down approach based on intermediate reference portfolios. It can be better understood by noninvestment professionals than yield-curve decomposition and is useful when  explaining the source of added value.

Building on the work of Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), the authors suggest that if US T-bills are the appropriate naive alternative for US investors, then asset allocation away from T-bills is, as commonly thought, the single decision with the greatest impact on an investor’s return. But if a diversified mix is the alternative, then the impact of departing from this alternative may be no greater than the impact of other decisions, including  security selection.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

This important paper pulls together the work of the BAI (1968), Fama (1972), and the Society of Investment Analysts (SIA 1972). The article establishes the importance of investment objectives, the nature of liabilities, the need for investment policies, and the responsibilities of trustees. Crucially, the author decomposes the decision-making process into policy decisions, strategy deci- sions, and selection. Holbrook suggests the use of notional funds for each step of the decision process and establishes a geometric relationship for the  value added (or subtracted) at each step of the process.

This book is important for demonstrating that a multinational portfolio is suboptimally managed if currency is not managed independently and for demonstrating the importance of interest rate differentials between  currencies.

Laker, Damian. 2000. “What Is This Thing Called ‘Interaction’?” Journal of  Performance Measurement 5 (1): 43–57.  In this paper, the author suggests that the interaction term has a bad reputation. He states that portfolio managers do not distinguish between interaction and error terms but arbitrarily add them to other terms. As a  result, they find interaction difficult to explain to clients.  The author argues that the interaction term is sometimes more explanatory than the other attributes and that attempts to avoid confusion by “getting rid of ” the interaction term in a Brinson model are, in fact, likely to create  more confusion.  Laker, Damian. 2001. “Incorporating Transaction Cost Measurement into  Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (4): 13–24.  This paper points out that transaction costs (explicit costs, such as brokerage  and taxes, and implicit costs, such as the bid–offer spread, market impact,  50  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The author suggests a stock-level, bottom-up style of attribution approach that identifies and separates the impact of intraday timing and transaction costs.  Laker, Damian. 2002. “A View from Down-Under.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 6 (4): 5–13.

The author defines transaction-based attribution, holdings-based attribu- tion, and transaction-based attribution that identifies transaction costs, and he provides worked examples of each. The paper explains that the simplicity, reduced number of calculations, and reduced data burden of  holdings-based attribution come at the cost of accuracy.  Laker, Damian. 2005. “Toward Consensus on Multiple-Period Arithmetic  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 9 (3): 26–37.

Lord, Timothy J. 1997. “The Attribution of Portfolio and Index Returns in  Fixed Income.” Journal of Performance Measurement 2 (1): 45–57.  This paper focuses on performance attribution as it applies to fixed-income portfolios and indexes. More clearly described as bottom-up contribution analysis of the portfolio compared with its benchmark, this paper emphasizes the requirement for the attribution to be consistent with the investment strategy of the portfolio manager. Income and price returns are calculated separately. Price return is then attributed according to duration, yield-curve distribution, sector allocation, and issue selection. Shift and twist are considered components of duration return; and sector and specific issuer effects are considered components of spread return. Included also are a calendar return (the price return resulting solely from the passage of time) and a residual return (the difference between the actual return and  the model’s estimate of return).  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Menchero, Jose G. 2000. “An Optimized Approach to Linking Attribution  Effects over Time.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (1): 36–42.  In this paper, the author presents an intuitive and robust algorithm for linking single-period attribution effects over time. The method consists of first deducing the correct scaling between the single-period excess returns and the linked excess return and then optimally distributing the residual  among the different time periods.  Menchero, Jose G. 2000/2001. “A Fully Geometric Approach to Performance  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (2): 22–30.  In this paper, the author examines the close relationship between geo- metric and arithmetic calculations and their effects and uses the analogy to arrive at an intuitive mathematical form for attribution analysis. Also, while addressing the issues involved in aggregating the attribution effects  across sectors, the author shows how they can be linked across time.

Menchero, Jose G., and Junmin Hu. 2003. “Errors in Transaction-Based  Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (1): 57–69.  The authors identify three types of transaction-based attribution: true time-weighted methods that use a buy-and-hold assumption and two types of transaction-based attribution based on modified Dietz return calcula- tions. The two latter types are as follows: Type 1, which accounts for exter- nal and internal cash flows, and Type 2, which accounts for internal cash flows only. The authors acknowledge that the holdings-based approach will lead to differences between the actual return and the computed return, but they suggest that the magnitude should be small and typically depend on volatility and portfolio turnover. They suggest that this difference should be attributed to trading effects. The authors show that both Type 1 and Type 2 approaches will lead to attribution errors, so they ultimately prefer  the holdings-based approach.

Sharpe describes the returns as leaving “tracks in the sand” that can be interpreted, by using regression analysis, as  style exposures.  Sharpe, William F. 1992. “Asset Allocation: Management Style and  Performance Measurement.” Journal of Portfolio Management 18 (2): 7–19.  The author, building on Sharpe (1988), suggests a 12-asset-class model that determines the passive return of a notional portfolio having the same style as the asset manager. The manager’s selection return is the difference  between the actual return and the passive return in the same style.  SIA. 1972. The Measurement of Portfolio Performance for Pension Funds.  Society of Investment Analysts.  Toward the end of 1970, a working group was set up by the UK Society of Investment Analysts to make recommendations on the subject of portfolio performance measurement for pension funds. The resulting report spe- cifically puts forward methods of calculating portfolio performance, thus  making possible a general comparison of funds.  The approach recommended has two aims: (1) the calculation of a rate of return for comparing funds and (2) the decomposition of the performance of a fund into two components—selection of stocks and selection of sec- tors. This report is, therefore, really the starting point of performance attri- bution because it both defines stock selection and sector allocation (called  “sector selection” in the report) and provides a worked example.

Spaulding, David, and Stephen Campisi. 2007. “A Case for Money-Weighted Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 11 (Performance Attribution  Supplement: 8–20.  The authors make the case for money-weighted attribution. Since cash flow movements are a factor that defines the investment process, cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation process and should not be neutralised, as they are in a time-weighted calculation. The authors point out that transaction-based attribution methodologies that use modified Dietz calculations are, in fact, money-weighted attributions  over a single period.  Stannard, John C. 1997. “Measuring Investment Returns of Portfolios Containing Derivatives: Part II—Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 1 (3): 5–9.  This paper demonstrates that a derivatives position can be represented as a series of (normally, two or more) notional asset exposures representing physi- cal securities and any implied borrowing used to finance the security position. Standard performance attribution techniques can be used on notional assets  to represent the derivatives in terms of the underlying investment decisions.  Surz, Ronald J. 1999/2000. “Attribution with Style.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 4 (2): 50–64.  This paper makes the case that manager style is a powerful determinant of performance. Style-based attribution produces much more reliable indicators than sector-based methods because most investment managers manage to a style rather than to some mix of economic sectors. Using sector-  based attribution analysis can produce significantly misleading inferences.  Van Breukelen, Gerard. 2000. “Fixed Income Attribution.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 4 (4): 61–68.

The Best of Both Worlds.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (2): 10–18.  The author lists the pros and cons of the arithmetic and geometric methods and concludes the geometric method is clearly superior in almost every way. The author states that the arithmetic method produces a distortion when applied to multiple-period attribution because returns naturally compound geometrically, not arithmetically. Nothing can be done to improve the arithmetic method to overcome this basic fact. What is not so well known is that the arithmetic method produces a distortion even for a single period when multiple currencies are involved. In conclusion, the author suggests a  method that is computed geometrically and presented arithmetically.

The author provides a new arithmetic formula that eliminates the drawbacks of multiperiod arithmetic attribution with no need for linking algorithms. She also presents an easy way of converting between arithmetic and geometric attribution so that expressing attribution results is just a  matter of preference.

Hensel, Ezra, and Ilkiw (1991) defined attribution as the “mathemati- cal process of explaining an investment return by relating it to the different risk-taking decisions implicit in the portfolio, and the extent to which each of those risks was rewarded or penalized in the capital markets” (p. 66). Colin (2014) said that the purpose of attribution is to disentangle the fund’s overall\\n\\nreturn into the component returns generated by each risk.\\n\\nIn other words, attribution measures which of your investment decisions about the portfolio’s underlying risks worked and which did not. This infor- mation is critical business intelligence for anyone involved in selecting, man- aging, or marketing investments. As the authors noted above, Fischer and Wermers (2013) considered attribution analysis to be the “description and the quantification of key factors on the returns of investment portfolios” (p. 395). DiBartolomeo (2003) considered performance attribution to be the process of disentangling component portions of the observed returns to draw conclu-\\n\\nsions about the strengths and weaknesses of the investment process.\\n\\nNote that these definitions are similar. The central question of an attribu- tion analysis is thus the following: To which investment decisions can the active\\n\\nreturn of a portfolio relative to its benchmark be traced over a given period?\\n\\nFormally, Bacon (2008) stated that “performance attribution is a tech- nique used to quantify the excess return of a portfolio against its benchmark into the active decisions of the investment decision process” (p. 117). Murira and Sierra (2006) considered performance attribution the ex post complement\\n\\nto the ex ante risk decomposition provided by the risk measurement process.\\n\\n“Performance attribution” is, therefore, perhaps a misleading term: As these descriptions suggest, the excess, active, or relative return is examined,\\n\\nnot the whole of the return (or absolute return). “Relative return attribution”\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Absolute attri- bution, or simply contribution analysis, would explain the sources of return of',\n",
       " 'a portfolio in isolation rather than in comparison with a benchmark.\\n\\nAs described in Bacon (2008), attribution analysis is a critical manage- ment tool for several key stakeholders in the asset management process. Above all, it is the main tool for performance analysts because it allows them to ensure that the return is correct. It allows them to participate in the invest- ment decision process by enabling them to demonstrably add value and thus justify their salary and effort. Return attribution, together with risk analy- sis, is the tool that allows the analyst to understand the sources of return in the portfolio and to communicate that understanding to portfolio managers,\\n\\nsenior managers, and asset owners.\\n\\nInvestment management firms themselves, and the portfolio managers they employ, are also major users of attribution analysis. Attribution analy- sis provides a good starting point for a dialogue with asset owners on the positive and negative aspects of recent performance. Attribution analysis can be used aggressively to identify underperformance early and provide clients with a thorough explanation of underperformance and, hopefully, a rationale for improving performance. Attribution analysis is also crucial in gaining the confidence of asset owners by demonstrating a good understanding of the\\n\\ndrivers of performance.\\n\\nPortfolio managers inhabit the front office of asset management firms; typically, performance analysts inhabit the middle office. The back office is also able to use daily, security-level attribution, however, as a diagnostic tool\\n\\nfor identifying pricing and transaction errors.\\n\\nBacon (2008) also stated that “senior management take an active interest in attribution analysis to provide them with a tool to monitor their portfolio managers. They will be keen to identify performance outliers—good or bad—\\n\\nand to ensure that value is added consistently across the firm” (p. 117).\\n\\nHence, attribution analysis has numerous uses across a wide range of',\n",

It should be consistent with the investment decision-making process of the portfolio. Performance attribution is most useful if it mirrors the investment management process because, in that case, it enables the iden-\\n\\ntification and explanation of the sources of excess return.\\n\\n2. It should be compatible with the organization’s performance measurement and risk measurement systems. Managers would have difficulty making effective use of the information provided by the performance attribution process if the data being explained by this process were inconsistent with\\n\\nthe data originating from the internal risk and performance systems.\\n\\nAs in many literature reviews, here the approach to the task is historical— beginning with the first attempts at performance measurement, about a half-\\n\\ncentury ago, and progressing to the present.\\n\\nEarly Development\\n\\nArguably, comparative performance measurement began with Dietz’s (1966) Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance and the Bank Administration Institute (BAI 1968) report Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison. The purpose of the BAI study was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The main\\n\\nconclusions of their study are still relevant:\\n\\n1. Performance measurement returns should be based on market value, not',\n",

All rights reserved.\\n\\n3\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nAlthough the report did not recommend the use of attribution analysis— instead, emphasizing the importance of the total return of the portfolio—it did suggest that comparison of various sector returns within the portfolio might be useful. Interestingly, Eugene Fama was later invited to write and\\n\\nwrote the chapter on risk for this report.\\n\\nFama Decomposition. Fama was the first to fully delve into the sub- ject of attribution analysis, which he did in “Components of Investment Performance” (Fama 1972). In this seminal paper, Fama suggested breaking down observed return into the part resulting from ability to pick the best securities at a given level of risk (which he at the time called “selectivity”; now, it is often referred to as “selection return”) and the part that is the result of predictions of general market price movements—that is, the return from\\n\\nsystematic risk—as follows:\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nExcess\\n\\nSelectivity\\n\\nSystematic risk\\n\\nwhere:\\n\\naverage portfolio return average market or benchmark return portfolio systematic risk\\n\\naverage risk-free rate\\n\\nIf a portfolio is fully diversified, it incurs no specific risk and the total portfolio risk will equal the systematic risk. Portfolio managers will give up diversification, however, to seek additional return. Therefore, the return from selectivity can be broken down into (1) the additional return required to jus- tify sacrificing a given amount of diversification and (2) the net return from selectivity (the remainder of the manager’s value added). The return from\\n\\nselectivity is equivalent to Jensen’s alpha,\\n\\n.\\n\\nThe term “diversification” (used in a different context from the one we would understand today) “is the return required to justify moving away from the benchmark and taking on specific risk” (Bacon 2013, p. 88). To calcu- late this diversification return, you first have to calculate the effective beta required such that systematic risk alone is equivalent to the total portfolio\\n\\nrisk. This beta is the Fama beta, calculated as follows:\\n\\nB.=—, o\\n\\n4\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nwhere:',\n",

Its approach, eventually published in 1972 (SIA 1972), had two aims: (1) the determination of a standard method of calculating a portfolio’s return, so that funds could be fairly compared, and (2) the decomposition of the performance of the fund into two components—selection of individual stocks and selection of stock sectors. The first aim is achieved by calculating the time-weighted rate of return using a simple approximation (which later became known as the analyst’s test method and ultimately became redundant as more accurate time-weighted returns became available). The second aim, the analysis of performance, is produced by constructing “notional funds” based on market\\n\\nindexes and comparing them with actual funds.\\n\\nThis early work dealt with equity-market sectors as the macro level of selection and securities within the sectors as the micro level, but common practice now is to regard asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as the macro level and securities within the asset class as the micro level. Thus, our discussion\\n\\nwill proceed from this latter starting point.\\n\\nThe working group established two notional funds as follows:\\n\\nThe working group established two notional funds as follows:\\n\\ne a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and\\n\\na fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and\\n\\ne apartly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).\\n\\na partly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).\\n\\nNote that the actual fund consists of actual returns and actual weights. The fully restrained fund (sometimes called the “fully notional fund”) represents the return on the policy portfolio—that is, the strategic bench-\\n\\nmark or policy weights set by the asset owner (represented by the pension\\n\\n6\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

       " 'where:\\n\\n= weight of the benchmark in the ith asset class (note )\\n\\n= return of the index in the ith asset class\\n\\nThe partly restrained fund (sometimes called the “semi-notional fund”) represents the intermediate return resulting from the actual weights deter- mined by the manager multiplied by the market index returns. Again, in\\n\\nmathematical notation,\\n\\nb, => w, xb, i=1\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nwhere is the weight of the portfolio in the ith asset class (note ).\\n\\nThe actual portfolio return in mathematical notation is\\n\\nr=) w,Xnr, isl\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nwhere r, is the return of the portfolio assets in the ith asset class.\\n\\nwhere is the return of the portfolio assets in the ith asset class.\\n\\nThe performance of a fund—in this case, a pension fund—thus depends on two factors: the selection of asset classes (typically, now described as asset allocation) and the selection of securities within an asset class. (As noted ear- lier, this analysis can also be applied to sector allocation and stock selection within sectors in an exactly parallel way.) The contribution of each of these components can be found by breaking down the transition from the actual\\n\\nfund to the fully restrained fund as shown in Table 1.',\n",

All rights reserved.\\n\\n7\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nThe success of the manager’s asset allocation is measured by comparing the performance of the partly restrained fund with that of the fully restrained fund. The success of the manager’s security selection is measured by compar-\\n\\ning the performance of the actual fund with that of the partly restrained fund.\\n\\nThe SIA (1972) report is thus crucial because it introduces the concepts of macro and micro levels of manager decision making and intermediate\\n\\nnotional portfolios to calculate these effects.\\n\\nIn “Investment Performance of Pension Funds” (Holbrook 1977), the British actuary J.P. Holbrook, in effect, pulled together the BAI (1968) report, Fama’s (1972) decomposition, and the SIA (1972) report. This virtu- ally unknown paper provides the foundation for much of the development in performance analysis that followed. Directing his advice to pension fund\\n\\ntrustees, Holbrook defined the decision-making process as follows:\\n\\nThe practical management of a pension fund investment portfolio involves\\n\\ndecisions at three levels.\\n\\ni) Policy, i.e. the proportions of the assets which, as a long-term aim, the trustees wish to hold in the different investment mar- kets. The fundamental element of policy is the split between equity-type and fixed-interest investments. Definition of pol- icy may extend to a split of equity-type investments between UK equities, overseas equities and properties, specific pro- portions being set for each. If the trustees are not experts in long-term investment, they will tend to formulate policy in discussion with specialist advisers; it is gratifying to record that actuaries who advise on the financing of pension schemes\\n\\nare increasingly becoming involved in such discussions.\\n\\nii) Strategy, i.e. decisions to depart from the policy proportions in the light of current market conditions, including decisions to hold part of the fund on short-term deposit. The trustees will usually seek advice from experts in the various markets regarding the short-term outlook, up to the time of the next investment meeting and over the next year or so. Except where trustees delegate strategic decisions to managers and advisers, investment meetings are usually held at short regular intervals, and arrangements are made for special meetings whenever it is thought that there has been a material change in market prospects. Often trustees authorize the managers concerned to determine the timing of purchases; thus, a manager is able to retain part of the assets entrusted to him in the form of short-',\n",

All rights reserved.\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\niii) Selection, i.e. the choice of the particular investments to hold, buy or sell within the various markets. Again, practice varies; many trustees give their managers carte blanche in this area—\\n\\nsome keep close control over day-to-day transactions. (p. 20)\\n\\nHolbrook went on to describe the trustees’ needs. First, they need to know whether the fund performed well, moderately, or badly. This knowledge requires the calculation of return, comparisons with market returns, and con-\\n\\nsideration of risk:\\n\\nThe performance of the fund as a whole, and within the different markets and sectors, must be examined separately. Secondly, the trustees need to be advised on the reasons for their fund’s performance; this may be inves- tigated by analysing the results to show contributions to total performance made by policy, strategy, and selection decisions. Finally, the trustees need help in interpreting the results as a guide to future action. Identification of points of strength and weakness in past performance may lead to reconsid- eration of policy and practice, of the decision-making process, and possibly\\n\\nto a change of manager. (p. 21)\\n\\nTo facilitate the breakdown of returns into policy, strategic, and selection\\n\\ndecisions, Holbrook suggested the return calculation of three notional funds:\\n\\nbased on the model, based on the trustees’ policy proportions, and\\n\\nbased on actual allocations.\\n\\nThen, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by\\n\\nThen, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nThe first factor represents the contribution to total performance resulting from the decision to adopt a policy that differs from the equity and fixed- interest proportions in the model [the industry standard allocation between equity and fixed income at the time]. The second, the contribution from the strategic decision to depart from policy proportions. The third, the contribution from selection decisions for the fixed-interest and equity\\n\\nsectors taken together. (Holbrook 1977, p. 31)\\n\\nThis passage is the first articulation of successive notional portfolios each of which isolates one step in the investment decision process. The fact that it\\n\\nwas written in 1977 shows how far ahead of his time Holbrook was.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n9\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nHolbrook (1977) linked this successive notional portfolio approach to Fama’s decomposition by equating the first factor to the investor’s return from systematic risk, the second factor to the manager’s return from systematic',\n",
       " 'risk, and the third factor to selectivity.\\n\\nFoundations\\n\\nThe Brinson Model. The next major development in attribution analysis stems from a series of papers written in the 1980s that collectively describe\\n\\nBrinson attribution.\\n\\nBrinson, Hood, and Beebower’s (1986) “Determinants of Portfolio Performance” is perhaps the most well-known paper on attribution. It pro- vided the name for the most common type of equity attribution model used today: the Brinson model. Despite being a relatively short paper, it made two\\n\\ncontributions:\\n\\n1. The general framework used to decompose total portfolio returns. Brinson et al. (1986) suggested a model for breaking down the arithmetic return in excess of the benchmark (r – b) under the assumption of a standard top-down investment decision process in which the portfolio manager seeks to add value through both timing and security selection. Figure 2 illustrates\\n\\ntheir framework for analysing portfolio returns.\\n\\nQuadrant I represents the policy benchmark return for a period—that is, the return on a hypothetical portfolio wherein the asset-class weights are those in long-term investment policy and the returns are those of the\\n\\nasset-class benchmarks\\n\\n.\\n\\nQuadrant I (9)\\n\\nQuadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.\\n\\nQuadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.\\n\\nIn timing, the portfolio manager seeks to add value by holding asset- class (or sector) weights in the portfolio that are different from the asset-class benchmark weights. An asset-class weight in the portfolio that is greater than the benchmark weight for that asset class would be described as overweight and a lesser weight would be described as underweight. Clearly, the portfolio manager will aim to overweight well-performing asset classes (or sectors) and\\n\\nunderweight poorly performing asset classes.\\n\\nQuadrant II minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-\\n\\ntracted value from timing only.\\n\\n10\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

In a more controversial practice, the framework is used on a sample of pension funds to demonstrate that most of the difference in returns among pension funds is the result of policy decisions, not timing or selection. This\\n\\nuse of the framework is responsible for much of its fame.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n11\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nAttribution Formulas. Brinson et al. (1986) may be the better known of the “Brinson papers,” but the more important paper in terms of the development of attribution is “Measuring Non-US Equity Portfolio Performance” by Brinson and Fachler (1985). Again, it is a short paper, but it documented for the first time the formulas required to calculate individual',\n",
       " 'attribution effects:\\n\\nn Allocation (Brinson and Fachler [1985] used the term “market selec-\\n\\ntion”). The contribution to excess return from asset allocation in the ith sector is\\n\\nA, =(w, -W.)x(b,-6).\\n\\nn Selection. The contribution to excess return from stock selection in\\n\\nsector i is\\n\\nS,=W,x(r,-4).\\n\\nn Interaction (Brinson and Fachler used the term “cross-product”). The\\n\\ncontribution to excess return from interaction in sector i is\\n\\nI, =(w;, -W,)x(7,—4;).\\n\\nWith a few modifications, these formulas provide the basic foundations for most of the attribution analysis used today. The terms “asset allocation,” “security selection,” and “interaction” are now universal and familiar to all. At the time, however, allocation might have been described as “timing,” “market selection,” or “weighting.” To establish when the term “allocation” was first used is difficult, but Cocks (1972) was among the first. He defined it as “all those decisions by which the portfolio manager allocates his funds among the selected securities (or broad classes of securities)” (p. 3). Asset allocation spe- cifically locates the decision process in what asset classes to hold and in what weights, and this terminology is associated with Ibbotson and Sinquefield\\n\\n(1982), although no one knows when the term was first used.\\n\\nUse of the term “interaction” (or “other” or “cross-product”) is difficult to establish, but certainly, by the early 1990s, “asset allocation,” “security selec-\\n\\ntion,” and “interaction” had become the most commonly used terms.\\n\\nThe Brinson et al. (1986) paper did not provide a formula for individual attribution effects, but the following variation of the allocation formula is\\n\\nassociated with that paper:\\n\\n12\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

(1986) intended this interpretation, and the Brinson and Fachler (1985) variant for asset allocation is far more common and better aligned with most investment decision processes. If the Brinson et al. definition is used, the contribution from asset allocation will be positive for any overweight sector in which the sector return is positive, but it will be positive when using the Brinson–Fachler definition only if the sector\\n\\nreturn exceeds the overall benchmark return.\\n\\nGraphically, the Brinson et al. (1986) method is easier to illustrate for each sector i than the Brinson and Fachler (1985) method, as shown in Figure 3. The contribution to portfolio return from sector i is the total area , and the contribution from the benchmark alone is area .

The same formulas as those suggested by Brinson–Fachler and associated with Brinson et al. (1986) can be found in a formal discussion response to a paper by Kingston (1973) presented to the Faculty of Actuaries on 14 October 1974, more than 10 years before the\\n\\nBrinson–Fachler paper was published.\\n\\nThe formulas may well have been developed prior to the publication of the Brinson and Fachler (1985), Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), Brinson, Singer, and Beebower (1991), and Singer (1996) papers, but collectively these papers established attribution analysis as an important aid in the critical review of active strategies and decision-making processes for asset managers,\\n\\nasset consultants, and asset owners.\\n\\nInteraction. Interaction is a controversial effect. Most authors—for example, Laker (2001), Spaulding (2003/2004), Campisi (2004b), and Bacon (2008)—would agree that the interaction effect is a directly calculated term, not a residual, but what does it mean? . . . It is certainly not intuitive. As noted, Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), arguably the first definers of the interaction effect, rather unhelpfully described this effect as “other” or a “cross-product”; they did not use the\\n\\nterm “interaction.” By the early 1990s, the term had become fairly universal\\n\\n14\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The interaction effect is clearly a cross-product, the combination of',\n",
       " 'allocation and selection decisions.\\n\\nLaker (2000) suggested “that when calculated properly, the interaction term plays a valuable role in explaining a portfolio’s active performance, and indeed that sometimes it is clearly more explanatory than the other attributes” (p. 43). Spaulding (2003/2004) was more nuanced in his comments, despite pointing out potentially misleading results (from mispriced securities or investing in sectors not in the benchmark). On balance, Spaulding suggested, it is best to calculate interaction, take the time to do some analysis, and then decide where to assign it, or better yet, show the interaction as a separate item and prepare to explain it. Campisi (2004b) and Bacon (2008) were less supportive of using the interaction effect; they suggested that it is not an active part of the investment decision process and, therefore, need not be calculated. Like many asset managers in practice, they suggested including\\n\\ninteraction in the selection effect.\\n\\nThe decision to include interaction with stock selection is not arbitrary. If you assume that asset allocation decisions are taken first in a top-down investment process, then the attribution from stock selection can be derived from Quadrant IV minus Quadrant II in Figure 2 and interaction need not be calculated at all. The decision to include interaction with stock selection is,\\n\\ntherefore, the direct result of the investment decision process.\\n\\nThe contribution to stock selection in the ith sector is now\\n\\nThe contribution to stock selection in the ith sector is now\\n\\nS,=w,x(r,-4,),\\n\\n(14)\\n\\n(14)\\n\\nand Figure 4 can now be redrawn as shown in Figure 5 with selection repre-\\n\\nsented by the area\\n\\n.\\n\\nMultiperiod Analysis\\n\\nThe attribution models described so far work well for single periods with static data. No obvious way exists, however, to combine attribution effects over time. Because of the multiplicative (geometric) nature of returns, arithmetic excess returns fail to add up over multiple periods. Carino (1999, p. 5) eloquently\\n\\nexplained the problem this way:\\n\\nOver multiple periods, the natural way to combine returns is to compound\\n\\nthem. The compounded return R over t periods is\\n\\nR=(14r)x(+n) xox (Ltn )-1. [15]\\n\\n[15]\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n15\\n\\nPerformance Attribution',\n",

Obviously, if multiperiod arithmetic excess returns do not add up, then clearly arithmetic attribution that adds up for sin- gle periods will not add up for multiple periods. Value added through active management decisions compounds over time, a fact that should be accounted for in multiperiod frameworks. Naturally, the end users of attribution analy-\\n\\nses expect their analyses to add up without residuals.\\n\\nSolutions can be categorized into two types, smoothing algorithms, such as those described by Carino (1999) and Menchero (2000), and linking algorithms (sometimes described as “dollar attribution”), such as those in GRAP (1997),\\n\\nFrongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede, Foresti, and Matheos (2002).1\\n\\nThe authors of each paper suggested that their method was the most appropriate to implement. Smoothing algorithms, in effect, take the result- ing residual and methodically redistribute it across other factors. Carino (1999) used logarithms, and Menchero (2000) redistributed the residual in an optimised way that minimised the change in any single factor. GRAP (1997), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002) compounded attribution effects through time and achieved identical results, but cru- cially, their methods are order dependent: If the time periods are reversed, the attribution result will change. Frongello acknowledged the order dependence but regarded it as a strength; others, including Laker (2002),\\n\\nwould describe it as a weakness.\\n\\n«\\n\\nDavies and Laker (2001) suggested an “exact” method for using the Brinson model to calculate attributes over multiple periods at a portfolio level, but not sector level. Because of the so-called exact nature of their model, they suggested it would be helpful to evaluate the accuracy of other pro- posed methods by comparison with their method at the total portfolio level. Many articles have been written critiquing and defending existing methods and offering refinements and new methods, including Banchik (2004/2005), Carino (2002), David (2012/2013), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), Jiang and Saenz (2014/2015), Kirievsky and Kirievsky (2000, 2004), Laker (2002, 2005), Menchero (2003), Mirabelli (2000/2001), Reztsov (2011/2012), Spaulding (2002), and Wong (2003/2004, 2007). By and large, however, the end user has proven to be unconcerned about these black box approaches, provided that the multiperiod arithmetic attribution adds up without residu- als. Frongello (2006) concluded that “although the mathematics can differ greatly from one method to another, the story told by the resulting attribution\\n\\nis the same regardless of the method” (p. 366).\\n\\n1Software providers have typically found solutions but often keep their methods more or less',\n",

Some would suggest that the problem with multiperiod attribution analysis stems from an incorrect definition of excess return itself. Bacon (2002) defined the arithmetic excess return as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the ini- tial value of the portfolio. That work defined the geometric excess return, , as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the final value of the notional fund. In other words, the geo- metric excess return measures the added value in terms of a percentage of the value of the notional fund assets at the end of the period, not the start, which\\n\\nis surely the main concern of any asset owner.\\n\\nBacon (2002) suggested that geometric excess returns are preferable because they are compoundable (geometric excess returns compound over multiple periods without residuals), they are convertible among currencies, and they are proportionate. The preferred definition of excess return should determine the choice of attribution methodology. Bain (1996), Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998), and Bacon (2002) each presented a geometric attribution model. Although developed independently and presented in dif- ferent ways, the models are, in fact, identical, which is an indication of the robustness of the approach. Geometric models built on the idea of successive notional portfolios can be found in Holbrook (1977), Hymans and Mulligan\\n\\n(1980), and Allen (1991). As shown in Figure 6, each successive portfolio\\n\\nFigure 6.

The difference between Step II and Step I represents the value added by active asset alloca- tion, and the difference between Step III and Step II represents the value added by security selection. More steps can be introduced for more complex,\\n\\nmultistep investment decision processes.\\n\\nIn the geometric attribution model, the difference between each step is\\n\\ncalculated geometrically:\\n\\n(19)\\n\\nBecause geometric excess returns compound through time and because geometric allocation effects and geometric selection effects compound together within each period, geometric allocation and geometric selection must also compound through time.

Interestingly, they made the case for geometric attribution in a single-period context, not necessarily a multiperiod one. They also drew a distinction between top-down and bottom-up investment decision processes. A bottom-up investment decision process, they noted, assumes that security\\n\\nselection takes precedence over asset allocation or is performed first.\\n\\nWeber (2018) would consider the Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and Bacon (2002) models to be semi-geometric models. The reason is that although total selection and allocation effects compound to the geometric excess return, the effects within selection and allocation are still arithmeti- cally calculated. Menchero (2001/2002) offered a fully geometric model in\\n\\nwhich individual selection and allocation effects compound through time.\\n\\nMulticurrency Attribution\\n\\nIn this section, we consider three works specifically directed to performance\\n\\nattribution in currency management.\\n\\nAllen (1991). In an article entitled “Performance Attribution for Global Equity Portfolios,” Allen took the Holbrook (1977) concept of successive intermediate portfolios and applied it in a multicurrency environment. Allen stated that the trick to quantifying the impact of each type of active manage- ment decision involved calculating the return on a theoretical portfolio where one type of decision had been neutralised. Comparison of the return on the manager’s portfolio (where no decisions had been neutralised) with the return on the portfolio where a class of management decisions had been neutralised\\n\\nallowed the impact of those neutralised decisions to be measured.\\n\\nWhen carried out correctly, this process is quite neat. No unexplained residuals remain. Allen’s article provides a framework for quantifying the marginal impact that both policy decisions and active management decisions have on the performance of a global equity portfolio. At the heart of this framework is the assumption that the total return on an actively managed\\n\\nglobal equity portfolio is explained by seven types of decisions:\\n\\n1. the choice, at the policy level, of the unhedged dollar-denominated index\\n\\nagainst which the active equity manager is to be measured\\n\\n2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country\\n\\n2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country\\n\\n3. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based\\n\\non the manager’s expectation of the country’s equity returns\\n\\n4. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based\\n\\non the manager’s expectation of the country’s currency returns\\n\\n20\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

This method allows for evaluation of the long-term contribution of a selected\\n\\ninvestment strategy to total return.\\n\\nAnkrim and Hensel (1992, 1994). In 1992, Ankrim and Hensel pub- lished a Russell Research Commentary setting out a framework for multicur- rency performance attribution. This article, building on work by Brinson and Fachler (1985), separated out the impact of currency decisions—in particular, it recognised the significance of differential interest rates in currency decision\\n\\nmaking. Ankrim and Hensel proposed\\n\\na method of performance attribution that retains the simplicity and intui- tive appeal of the Brinson and Fachler approach but breaks the returns from currency into two components: one that recognizes the opportunity cost of returns achievable in forward-currency markets and a second that measures the return attributable to the currency being less than fully hedged, both in the portfolio and in the benchmark with which the portfolio is com-\\n\\npared. (p. 2)\\n\\nIn the 1992 paper, Ankrim and Hensel identified three reasons that\\n\\nincluding currency exposure in performance attribution causes problems:\\n\\nFirst, and most obvious, it alters the returns ultimately received by the cli- ent. In Brinson and Fachler [1985], all returns are denominated in the home currency, but this convention makes it impossible to separate the contribu- tion to returns made by the manager’s country and security selection deci-',\n",
       " 'sions from the impact of currency translation gains and losses.\\n\\nSecond, in practice, many portfolios have some portion (but not necessarily all) of their currency exposure hedged away. This requires an approach to performance attribution that allows the proportion of currency exposure\\n\\nhedged to be variable.\\n\\nThird, even if a portfolio is completely hedged, the client may choose to\\n\\nadopt a benchmark that is less than fully hedged. (p. 2)\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n21\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nThe authors defined two components of currency return: currency surprise and the forward premium. Currency surprise is uncertain, but the forward premium element is not because it depends on interest rate differentials at the\\n\\ntime of purchase:\\n\\nAny approach to multicurrency attribution that lumps the forward premium and currency surprise together will credit positive performance to manag- ers who have large exposures in countries with positive forward premiums. Such an approach would penalize managers who hold large positions in\\n\\ncountries with negative forward premiums. (p. 12)\\n\\nKarnosky and Singer (1994). Arguably the single most important paper published on attribution in the 1990s is Karnosky and Singer. This paper not only demonstrates that managing multicurrency portfolios is sub-optimal if currency is not managed independently but also provides a framework for calculating attribution effects, while critically, taking into account interest rate differentials. Karnosky and Singer resolved the issue of market and currency compounding by using continuously compounded returns in their model, admittedly this is only referred to in the small print, and solved the forward premium concern by thinking in terms of a “return premium” above local interest rates. Karnosky and Singer explained that the term “return premium” is used, rather than the more familiar “risk premium,” to make a subtle distinction in the underlying cash return. “Risk premium” refers to the return of a risky asset in excess of the return of a riskless asset, but in the authors’ analysis, the premiums depend on forward contracts with long maturities, where risk is probably not the dominant factor; hence, the\\n\\nterm “return premium” is used.\\n\\nKarnosky and Singer’s framework demonstrates that separate currency and market strategies can be implemented within a global portfolio in which a specific currency weight is different from the weight of the associated country market. In effect, the authors applied the standard Brinson methodology twice—once to global portfolios by using local-return premiums (rather than simply local returns) to measure allocation and selection effects and, separately, to cash returns in the base currency of the asset owner in order to\\n\\ncalculate independent currency effects, as shown in Figure 7.\\n\\n22\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Holdings-based attribution.\\n\\n1. Holdings-based attribution.\\n\\nHoldings-based or position-based attribution is calculated by analysing the underlying beginning-period holdings of the portfolio only.

Returns-based attribution.\\n\\nReturns-based (or factor) attribution uses the historical returns of the total portfolio and/or individual securities to decompose the total return into multiple factors. The multifactor model is a regression equation that describes the way a particular security or portfolio reacts to industry sec-\\n\\ntor, fundamental, macroeconomic, and other market factors.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n23\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nAsset-Grouping Attribution. The type of attribution favoured by the asset manager or asset owner will vary according to the investment decision process, investment objective, quality and availability of data, cost and time considerations, complexity, and reporting objective. Holdings-based and transaction-based attributions are mutually exclusive, and the choice is based on (for holdings based) cost, quality of data, ease of use, and rapid implemen- tation against (for transaction based) the advantages of reconciliation to the client-reported return, completeness, and accuracy. A number of authors— Giguere (2003), Bonafede and McCarthy (2003), Spaulding (2003a), Menchero and Hu (2003), and Bacon (2008)—argued for one approach or another. Spaulding, without an eye to existing software (and thus genuinely independently), concluded that the question “which is better?” does not have a simple answer. Too many variables are at work; in the end, the choice comes down to user preference. In later research, Spaulding (2018) showed that the residual implicit in holdings-based attribution can be extensive and is not nec- essarily correlated with turnover. Both holdings-based and transaction-based attribution are also described as “asset-grouping” or “variance type” attribu- tion, reflecting their requirements for asset allocation data and variance from',\n",

Returns-based attribution, in contrast to the asset-grouping approach, might complement either holdings- or trans- action-based attribution in that it might reveal unexpected biases and make communication easier for asset managers using a factor-focused investment decision process. Returns-based attribution is a direct descendant of Fama (1972) decomposition, which is a single-factor model, via Sharpe (1988) and Fama and French (1993)—both three-factor models that include a general market factor together with a size and value factor—and Carhart (1997), a\\n\\nfour-factor model that introduced a momentum factor.\\n\\nAmenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:\\n\\nAmenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:\\n\\n1.

All rights reserved.\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nWithin this framework, Amenc and Le Sourd (2003) described a wide\\n\\nrange of multifactor models in detail.\\n\\nWilliam F. Sharpe, who is associated with style attribution starting with his 1988 paper (see Sharpe 1988, 1992), used a 12-factor model to determine the passive return of a portfolio with the same style as the active asset man- ager. The difference between the actual portfolio return and the passive return with the same style would be a result of the manager’s selection ability. This type of style analysis provides a natural method for constructing appropriate style benchmarks. Sharpe (1988) stated that the usefulness of the asset-class model depends on the asset classes chosen for implementation. It is desirable',\n",
       " 'that asset classes\\n\\ne be mutually exclusive,\\n\\nbe mutually exclusive,\\n\\ne be exhaustive, and\\n\\nbe exhaustive, and\\n\\ne have returns that differ.\\n\\nhave returns that differ.\\n\\nEach asset class should be proxied by a market capitalization–weighted index of the securities in it, and no security should be included in more than one asset class. Also, the asset classes should have low correlations with each other (or different standard deviations if correlations are high, as is the case in\\n\\nmany fixed-income styles or asset subclasses).\\n\\nSurz (1999/2000) suggested a holdings-based or transaction-based form of style attribution based on the exclusive style characteristics of the hold- ings in the portfolio and benchmark. Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2005) proposed a regression-based attribution system linked to the parameters from the “Fundamental Law of Active Management” (Grinold and Kahn 1995, pp. 117–35). In a slight oversimplification, the fundamental law says that alpha is a function of manager skill as well as breadth (the number of inde- pendent bets made by the manager). The investigation by Clarke et al. (2005) indicated that the “law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression- based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise\\n\\nrelated to constraints in constructing the portfolio” (p. 81).\\n\\nReturns-based or regression-based attribution has the following\\n\\ncharacteristics:\\n\\ne It does not necessarily require the composition of the portfolio.\\n\\nIt does not necessarily require the composition of the portfolio.\\n\\ne It complements traditional holdings- or transaction-based attribution.\\n\\nIt complements traditional holdings- or transaction-based attribution.\\n\\n= It is relatively easy and cost-effective to implement.\\n\\nIt is relatively easy and cost-effective to implement.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Often, this failure occurs because returns are not adjusted for systematic risk and style (high vs. low beta, large vs. small size, value vs. growth orientation, etc.). Simply applying the alloca- tion/selection model often results in attribution results that are not neces- sarily meaningful because they do not reflect the investment process or the risks that drove return over the evaluation period. Risk-adjusted attribution is the real Cinderella of attribution analysis: In practice, risk-adjusted attri- bution is rarely performed. Ankrim (1992) proposed a form of risk-adjusted attribution using beta, as did Bacon (2008) and Obeid (2005). Kophamel (2003), thinking in terms of the volume of “performance cubes” rather than the familiar “performance areas” of the Brinson model, proposed attribution analysis in three dimensions. Spaulding (2016) suggested adjusting for total risk rather than systematic risk—in effect, attributing M2 returns (described',\n",
       " 'in Modigliani 1997).2 Rather satisfactorily, Fisher and D’Alessandro (2019)\\n\\n2Modigliani risk-adjusted performance (also known as M2, M2, the Modigliani–Modigliani measure, or RAP) is a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of some investment portfolio. It measures the returns of the portfolio adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of\\n\\nsome benchmark (e.g., the market).\\n\\n26\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Van Breukelen described a top-down investment deci- sion process in which overall duration is the first decision followed by a mar- ket allocation decision—a combination of country weight and duration—and finally, an issue selection decision within country. Currency effects are mea- sured separately using a Karnosky and Singer (1994) type of approach. The value added by each step of the decision process is measured by using a series\\n\\nof reference or successive notional portfolios.\\n\\nFixed-Income Attribution\\n\\nThe simple Brinson model is widely regarded as being insufficient for all but the simplest of fixed-income investment strategies. McLaren (2002) explained that classical attribution models (e.g., Brinson’s model) are inap- propriate for fixed-income portfolio analysis because the allocation decision in equity models does not explicitly account for yield-curve positioning (dura- tion) set by fixed-income managers. This omission is significant because the duration decision, which has no direct equity counterpart, plays an impor- tant role in the fixed-income decision-making process. Campisi (2000) also explained why fixed income needs its own attribution model and pointed out\\n\\nfive critical differences between stocks and bonds:\\n\\n1. Bonds are temporary lending agreements with a stated maturity, whereas\\n\\nstocks are permanent investments.\\n\\n2. Bonds promise a fixed return, with a strictly defined upside if held to maturity; stocks promise uncertain returns and the unlimited upside (and\\n\\ndownside) associated with ownership.\\n\\n3. Bonds are typically purchased by institutions, which often hold them until maturity. This pattern results in a limited secondary market for bonds. Stock investing takes place in an active secondary market. As a\\n\\nresult, bonds are illiquid compared with stocks.\\n\\n4. Bond performance is driven by promised income and by changes in market yields: When market yields rise above a bond’s stated yield, the price of that bond falls. As a result, the relevant risk for bonds is sensitivity to changes in yields. Stock performance is driven by the market’s economic sectors, and the principal risks for stocks are (a) sensitivity to the overall market, or beta,\\n\\nand (b) the individual fortunes of the company invested in.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

For example, bonds with the same maturity and default risk will generally sell at the same price. Therefore, bonds reflect little selection effect. Stock prices, in contrast, respond dramatically to company-specific conditions and thus reflect a',\n",
       " 'large selection effect.\\n\\nDistinct approaches for fixed-income attribution emerged quite quickly in the early development of attribution. The method described in Wagner and Tito (1977) is derived directly from Fama decomposition, with beta replaced by a systematic risk measure for bonds—namely, duration. In this approach, fixed-income portfolio performance is driven by promised income and by the\\n\\neffect that changes in yields have on bond prices.\\n\\nNo single, standardised way of defining fixed-income attribution exists. The asset class has more securities than in equity investing, more types of instruments, more variety in investment process, and more quantitative mod- elling requirements. It also has various ways of describing change in the yield curve and a broad array of investment mandates. Murira and Sierra (2006) explained that each of the commercially available systems uses its own partic- ular brand of return attribution. In fact, because of differences in the defini- tion and computation of the factors, different systems often provide different\\n\\nvalues for the same return factor.\\n\\nOther authors have made various contributions to developments in fixed-income attribution—developments often linked to specific invest- ment decision processes or specific software capabilities. These authors include Ramaswamy (2001), Giguere (2005), Colin (2005, 2014), Gillet and Hommolie (2006), Colin, Cubilie, and Bardoux (2006), Silva, de Carvalho,\\n\\nand Ornelas (2010), Simmons and Karadakov (2013/2014), and Dias (2017).\\n\\nFigure 8 illustrates the attribution effects in a typical fixed-income attri- bution model. Here, carry represents the return resulting from the passage of time: coupon payments, accrued interest, and rolling down the yield curve (the\\n\\npull-to-par effect as the instrument approaches maturity).\\n\\nIn Figure 8, the yield-curve factor represents the changing shape of the yield curve, parallel shift (the impact of a parallel move of the yield curve), twist (a change in slope of the yield curve), and curvature (change in the curvature of the yield curve). Often, twist and curvature are combined and\\n\\ndescribed as nonparallel changes in the yield curve or curve reshape.\\n\\nSpread is the return that comes from the widening or narrowing of credit',\n",

Normally quite small, residuals are classified by Dias (2017) as caused by the model or caused by data errors and systematic or\\n\\nrandom effects.\\n\\nIn the other category, the price effect captures the difference in price sources between the bonds in the portfolio and bonds in the benchmark. This is a nonmanagement effect that is a particular problem for fixed income. The trading effect measures the impact of intraday trading. Currency captures the impact of independent currency management, typically by using a Karnosky\\n\\nand Singer (1994) type of approach.\\n\\nFixed-income attribution models can be characterised as either top-down successive portfolio methods (e.g., Van Breukelen 2000) or bottom-up (yield- curve decomposition) methods. Bottom-up methods calculate the impact of yield-curve movements and credit spreads on individual bonds in both the portfolio and the benchmark and aggregate results. Top-down models are perhaps easier to implement and more effective in terms of communicating to\\n\\nasset owners and other stakeholders.\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\n29\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nGillet and Hommolie (2006) described the bottom-up approach as a suc- cessive spread methodology that can be split into two phases. The first phase consists of decomposing the bond prices into its various characteristics (pas- sage of time, evolution of yield curves, variation of spreads). This decomposi- tion is applied simultaneously to the constituents of the portfolio and to the constituents of the benchmark. The second phase consists only of regrouping the separated elements according to the investment decision process (p. 65). Bottom-up models are more difficult and expensive to implement but more\\n\\nappropriate to the detailed investment decision processes of the front office.\\n\\nMcLaren (2002) offered a geometric fixed-income attribution model, which is not common. Most fixed-income attribution models are arithme- tic in nature, although for the most part, they can be adapted for geometric analysis. The reason may be that excess returns are typically smaller than in equity investing and the underlying benchmark returns less volatile, mak- ing the difference between geometric and arithmetic excess return smaller in',\n",
       " 'magnitude.\\n\\nOther Attribution Issues\\n\\nOther issues in attribution pertain to derivatives, transaction costs, frequency\\n\\nof the analysis, and application to money-weighted returns.\\n\\nDerivatives. The Brinson model is an incredibly robust methodology. Stannard (1997), Menchero (2002/2003), Bacon (2008), Fischer and Wermers (2013), and Bacon, Thompson, and van der Westhuizen (2018)—all described, using appropriate notional assets and notional returns, how the standard Brinson model can be adapted to handle derivative instruments, including\\n\\nindex futures, options (of various types), and swaps and short positions.\\n\\nTransaction Costs. Laker (2001) pointed out that transaction costs— explicit costs (such as brokerage and taxes) and implicit costs (such as the bid–offer spread, market impact, and opportunity cost)—are not dealt with explicitly in most performance attribution methods but are normally included within the stock selection effect. In a bottom-up, security-level attribution approach, Laker suggested using the standard Brinson selection formulas at the security level to calculate the impact of transaction costs (explicit and implicit) and intraday timing effects. He suggested that any return difference between an individual security’s daily return and its return in the index must\\n\\nbe the result of transaction costs and timing within the day.\\n\\nFrequency of Analysis. DiBartolomeo (2003) challenged the assump-\\n\\ntion that aggregated daily attribution analysis is more appropriate than\\n\\n30\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nmonthly aggregated analysis and suggested that applying typical attribution methods to daily data draws on assumptions that are highly biased and unre- liable. Beyond simply observing the attributed returns, he believed, you must be able to judge their statistical significance. He suggested that recommend-\\n\\ning daily observation rests on four fallacies:\\n\\n1. Daily performance is economically meaningful. Not necessarily—for example, information is lost by adjusting for the timing of cash flows in',\n",
       " 'time-weighted returns.\\n\\n2. Daily returns are themselves accurate. Not necessarily—many securities are traded on multiple exchanges or electronic markets at different times, so exactly which closing price is used to compute the daily returns can have a sizable impact. Also, coordinating the timing of corporate actions\\n\\nsuch as dividends, spin-offs, and mergers with index providers is difficult.\\n\\n3. Observations are assumed to be independent. Investment portfolios do not start as a fresh set of management decisions every trading day. Thus the rationale of an independent “start fresh” assumption is weak. Substantial path dependencies are present in portfolio management in practice, which reduces any justification for the assumption of indepen-\\n\\ndent periodic observations of manager skill.\\n\\n4. Parametric distributional assumptions are accurate. Most of the aca- demic literature illustrates that the imperfections of our assumptions with respect to quarterly or monthly return data are small, whereas for daily data, we must consistently reject the correctness of the assumptions. In general, daily security returns have fat-tailed distributions, with large return events occurring far more often than would be consistent with a normal distribution. This issue is less of a problem with quarterly or\\n\\nmonthly returns.\\n\\nDiBartolomeo (2003) concluded that daily performance attribution com- pounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return than attribu- tion using less frequent data—but at a tremendous cost in our ability to judge the statistical significance of the results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in our estimates of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors (believing an estimate is\\n\\nstatistically significant when it is not).\\n\\nDarling and MacDougall (2002/2003) certainly questioned the ben- efits of more frequent and more detailed performance measurement. They suggested that the cost of daily stock-level attribution is difficult to justify\\n\\n(although given recent developments in technology their views may have\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

They suggested that monthly modified Dietz calculations might actually be near the optimum balance and that a simple alternative might be\\n\\nrunning actual profit and loss for each position.3\\n\\nFrongello (2006), in contrast, made the case for daily attribution analysis. He explained that in the real world, risk factor mismatches may occur unin- tentionally—caused by neglect, accidents, or simply changes in the risk pro- file of securities. Performance attribution should seek to explain performance resulting from all risk factor mismatches. Daily attribution is the best method\\n\\nfor monitoring the status and consequence of risk factor mismatches (p. 367).\\n\\nZangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) suggested that daily attribution, if done methodically, should produce results that are superior to monthly attri- bution. They pointed out that regardless of the methodology used, what is ultimately critical is the process governing attribution. The five core compo- nents of what they considered to be a good return attribution process are as\\n\\nfollows:\\n\\n1. Data management and quality control. This task is the most important. Positions, prices, corporate actions, and so on, must be accurately cap-\\n\\ntured, processed, and incorporated.\\n\\n2. Infrastructure. Without proper infrastructure (efficient application of',\n",
       " 'hardware and databases), the chance of errors and delays increases.\\n\\n3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.\\n\\n3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.\\n\\n4. Methods. For example; daily buy-and-hold, monthly buy-and-hold, and\\n\\ntransaction-based attribution.\\n\\n5. Reports. The way in which information is presented is important, so\\n\\ntimely, accurate, and easy-to-understand attribution reports are necessary.\\n\\nZangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) concluded that process plays a criti- cal part in determining the accuracy of attribution results. Return attribution should be based on a process that monitors key input data and evaluates attri-\\n\\nbution results on a daily basis.\\n\\nAttribution of Money-Weighted Return. For purposes of comparative analysis, most attribution analysis is naturally undertaken on time-weighted rates of return (TWR). Attribution analysis of money-weighted rates of return (MWR) is less common. Yet, attribution analysis of MWR is still\\n\\nundertaken in the form of the modified Dietz return calculation method.\\n\\n3The modified Dietz method is a mathematical technique to evaluate a portfolio’s return based on a weighted calculation of its cash flow. The method takes into account the timing of\\n\\ncash flows and assumes a constant rate of return over a specified period of time.\\n\\n32\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.\\n\\nPerformance Attribution\\n\\nIt was, in fact, recommended by Menchero and Hu (2003) in the context of transaction-based attribution and by Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003). O’Shea and Jeet (2018) suggested single-period attribution of modified Dietz returns for private equity. Spaulding and Campisi (2007) made the case for money-weighted attribution. They suggested that because cash flow move- ments are a factor that defines the investment process, these cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation system instead of\\n\\nbeing neutralised (as occurs in the time-weighted calculation).\\n\\nThe modified Dietz method is a first-order approximation of the internal rate of return (IRR) and, according to Bacon (2007a), an intermediate step in the evolution from calculating IRR (which some might describe as a true MWR) to the true TWR. The IRR is a standard return measure for illiquid asset classes—such as private equity, real estate, and infrastructure—and is common at the total-asset owner level, where comparative analysis is less rel- evant. The modified Dietz method is easy to disaggregate and more straight- forward to attribute than the IRR. Nevertheless, Illmer and Marty (2003) and Illmer (2009) offered a solution to the attribution of the true MWR in',\n",
       " 'terms of both return and profit and loss.\\n\\nD’Alessandro (2016) suggested analysts should end the debate about which method of return to use, TWR or MWR, and require the presentation\\n\\nof both with an attribution between the two.\\n\\nConclusion: The Evolution of Attribution Methodologies\\n\\nThe evolution of attribution analysis is clear, easy to trace, and illustrated in Figure 9, which maps, not necessarily in chronological order, the major\\n\\ndevelopments in attribution analysis discussed in this review.\\n\\nComparative performance measurement starts with the BAI (1968) study, but attribution analysis itself starts with Fama (1972). From that point, a divergence occurs between asset-grouping and variance-type attribution, with the UK SIA (1972) introducing the concept of selection, allocation, and notional portfolios and return-based attribution developed a little later by Sharpe (1992), Fama and French (1993), Carhart (1997), and many others. Fixed-income attribution naturally veers in a different direction via Wagner and Tito (1977), who replaced beta with duration in the Fama decomposition, and Lord (1997), who responded to the investment decision processes of bond\\n\\nmanagers, which are so different from those of equity managers.\\n\\nVery early, a split occurred between, on the one hand, the dominant arithmetic Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson et al. model (1986) and, on the other hand, the total level geometric approach of Holbrook (1977).\\n\\nSmoothing and linking algorithms were soon needed in order for multiperiod\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Allen (1991) is a direct link from Holbrook but addressed multicurrency issues. Burnie et al.

In more recent years, we have seen many variants of yield-curve decomposition models, which reflects the diver- sity of fixed-income investment decision processes.

Shift is a parallel movement of the curve across all maturities. Twist is a steepening or flattening of the curve, and curvature occurs when a curve becomes more or less humped.

More clearly described as bottom-up contribution analysis of the portfolio compared with its benchmark, this paper emphasizes the requirement for the attribution to be consistent with the investment strategy of the portfolio manager. Income and price returns are calculated separately. Price return is then attributed according to duration, yield-curve distribution, sector allocation, and issue selection. Shift and twist are considered components of duration return; and sector and specific issuer effects are considered components of spread return. Included also are a calendar return (the price return resulting solely from the passage of time) and a residual return (the difference between the actual return and\\n\\nthe model’s estimate of return).\\n\\n© 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Hensel, Ezra, and Ilkiw (1991) defined attribution as the “mathemati- cal process of explaining an investment return by relating it to the different risk-taking decisions implicit in the portfolio, and the extent to which each of those risks was rewarded or penalized in the capital markets” (p. 66). Colin (2014) said that the purpose of attribution is to disentangle the fund’s overall  return into the component returns generated by each risk.  In other words, attribution measures which of your investment decisions about the portfolio’s underlying risks worked and which did not. This infor- mation is critical business intelligence for anyone involved in selecting, man- aging, or marketing investments. As the authors noted above, Fischer and Wermers (2013) considered attribution analysis to be the “description and the quantification of key factors on the returns of investment portfolios” (p. 395). DiBartolomeo (2003) considered performance attribution to be the process of disentangling component portions of the observed returns to draw conclu-  sions about the strengths and weaknesses of the investment process.  Note that these definitions are similar. The central question of an attribu- tion analysis is thus the following: To which investment decisions can the active  return of a portfolio relative to its benchmark be traced over a given period?  Formally, Bacon (2008) stated that “performance attribution is a tech- nique used to quantify the excess return of a portfolio against its benchmark into the active decisions of the investment decision process” (p. 117). Murira and Sierra (2006) considered performance attribution the ex post complement  to the ex ante risk decomposition provided by the risk measurement process.  “Performance attribution” is, therefore, perhaps a misleading term: As these descriptions suggest, the excess, active, or relative return is examined,  not the whole of the return (or absolute return). “Relative return attribution”  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  1  Performance Attribution  or simply “attribution analysis” is perhaps better terminology. Absolute attri- bution, or simply contribution analysis, would explain the sources of return of',\n",
       " 'a portfolio in isolation rather than in comparison with a benchmark.  As described in Bacon (2008), attribution analysis is a critical manage- ment tool for several key stakeholders in the asset management process. Above all, it is the main tool for performance analysts because it allows them to ensure that the return is correct. It allows them to participate in the invest- ment decision process by enabling them to demonstrably add value and thus justify their salary and effort. Return attribution, together with risk analy- sis, is the tool that allows the analyst to understand the sources of return in the portfolio and to communicate that understanding to portfolio managers,  senior managers, and asset owners.  Investment management firms themselves, and the portfolio managers they employ, are also major users of attribution analysis. Attribution analy- sis provides a good starting point for a dialogue with asset owners on the positive and negative aspects of recent performance. Attribution analysis can be used aggressively to identify underperformance early and provide clients with a thorough explanation of underperformance and, hopefully, a rationale for improving performance. Attribution analysis is also crucial in gaining the confidence of asset owners by demonstrating a good understanding of the  drivers of performance.  Portfolio managers inhabit the front office of asset management firms; typically, performance analysts inhabit the middle office. The back office is also able to use daily, security-level attribution, however, as a diagnostic tool  for identifying pricing and transaction errors.  Bacon (2008) also stated that “senior management take an active interest in attribution analysis to provide them with a tool to monitor their portfolio managers. They will be keen to identify performance outliers—good or bad—  and to ensure that value is added consistently across the firm” (p. 117).  Hence, attribution analysis has numerous uses across a wide range of',\n",
       " 'asset management stakeholders.  Lord (1997) suggested that the characteristics of a good attribution sys-  tem would include the following:  ¢ aconsistent approach for analysing returns,  a consistent approach for analysing returns,  e asolid theoretical framework for valuation,  a solid theoretical framework for valuation,  e the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,  the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,  attribution factors consistent with decision variables of the portfolio strat-  egy process,  2  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  • summary attribution analysis constructed from security details, which  themselves should be available for inspection,  e transactions, and  transactions, and  • robust analytic systems and high-quality data to provide meaningful  attribution results.  Murira and Sierra (2006) suggested that there is general agreement that  an attribution framework must meet two key requirements:  1. It should be consistent with the investment decision-making process of the portfolio. Performance attribution is most useful if it mirrors the investment management process because, in that case, it enables the iden-  tification and explanation of the sources of excess return.  2. It should be compatible with the organization’s performance measurement and risk measurement systems. Managers would have difficulty making effective use of the information provided by the performance attribution process if the data being explained by this process were inconsistent with  the data originating from the internal risk and performance systems.  As in many literature reviews, here the approach to the task is historical— beginning with the first attempts at performance measurement, about a half-  century ago, and progressing to the present.  Early Development  Arguably, comparative performance measurement began with Dietz’s (1966) Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance and the Bank Administration Institute (BAI 1968) report Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison. The purpose of the BAI study was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The main  conclusions of their study are still relevant:  1. Performance measurement returns should be based on market value, not',\n",
       " 'cost.  Returns should be total returns.  wk  2. Returns should be total returns.  Returns should be time weighted. &  3. Returns should be time weighted.

Interestingly, Eugene Fama was later invited to write and  wrote the chapter on risk for this report.  Fama Decomposition. Fama was the first to fully delve into the sub- ject of attribution analysis, which he did in “Components of Investment Performance” (Fama 1972). In this seminal paper, Fama suggested breaking down observed return into the part resulting from ability to pick the best securities at a given level of risk (which he at the time called “selectivity”; now, it is often referred to as “selection return”) and the part that is the result of predictions of general market price movements—that is, the return from  systematic risk—as follows:  (1)  Excess  Selectivity  Systematic risk  where:  average portfolio return average market or benchmark return portfolio systematic risk  average risk-free rate  If a portfolio is fully diversified, it incurs no specific risk and the total portfolio risk will equal the systematic risk. Portfolio managers will give up diversification, however, to seek additional return. Therefore, the return from selectivity can be broken down into (1) the additional return required to jus- tify sacrificing a given amount of diversification and (2) the net return from selectivity (the remainder of the manager’s value added). The return from  selectivity is equivalent to Jensen’s alpha,  .  The term “diversification” (used in a different context from the one we would understand today) “is the return required to justify moving away from the benchmark and taking on specific risk” (Bacon 2013, p. 88). To calcu- late this diversification return, you first have to calculate the effective beta required such that systematic risk alone is equivalent to the total portfolio  risk. This beta is the Fama beta, calculated as follows:  B.=—, o  4  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  (2)  Performance Attribution  where:',\n",
       " 'where:  6 = portfolio risk  portfolio risk  6, = benchmark risk  benchmark risk  Therefore, the return required to justify not being fully diversified is cal- culated by using the difference between the Fama beta and the portfolio beta  as follows:  d=(B, -B)x(b-7).  @)  (3)  Note that the “Fama beta will always be greater than or equal to the port- folio beta since total risk is greater than or equal to the systematic risk of the  portfolio” (Bacon 2013, p. 89).  The net return from selectivity (“net selectivity,” for short) is the remain- ing return from selectivity after deducting the amount of return required to  justify not being fully diversified:  Net selectivity = Selectivity — Diversification.  Net selectivity = Selectivity – Diversification.  Net selectivity = Sy,, =a—d.  Net selectivity =  If net selectivity is negative, the portfolio manager has failed to justify the  loss of diversification.  Timing is the return from the manager’s variations in systematic risk  (beta) around some policy or target amount:  (4)  where B, = the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  where  the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  Figure 1 illustrates Fama’s decomposition for portfolio A. represents the return from systematic risk (conventional beta) plus the risk-free rate, and  represents the return from the Fama beta plus the risk-free rate.  Fama’s (1972) “Components of Investment Performance” is the first paper to seriously analyse the sources of return of an investment portfolio and,  therefore, represents the birth of attribution analysis.  Notional Funds. In response to the BAI (1968) paper, a working group was set up towards the end of 1970 by the Society of Investment Analysts  (SIA) in the United Kingdom to make recommendations on the subject  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Its approach, eventually published in 1972 (SIA 1972), had two aims: (1) the determination of a standard method of calculating a portfolio’s return, so that funds could be fairly compared, and (2) the decomposition of the performance of the fund into two components—selection of individual stocks and selection of stock sectors. The first aim is achieved by calculating the time-weighted rate of return using a simple approximation (which later became known as the analyst’s test method and ultimately became redundant as more accurate time-weighted returns became available). The second aim, the analysis of performance, is produced by constructing “notional funds” based on market  indexes and comparing them with actual funds.  This early work dealt with equity-market sectors as the macro level of selection and securities within the sectors as the micro level, but common practice now is to regard asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as the macro level and securities within the asset class as the micro level. Thus, our discussion  will proceed from this latter starting point.  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  e a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  e apartly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  a partly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  Note that the actual fund consists of actual returns and actual weights. The fully restrained fund (sometimes called the “fully notional fund”) represents the return on the policy portfolio—that is, the strategic bench-  mark or policy weights set by the asset owner (represented by the pension  6  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The performance of a fund—in this case, a pension fund—thus depends on two factors: the selection of asset classes (typically, now described as asset allocation) and the selection of securities within an asset class. (As noted ear- lier, this analysis can also be applied to sector allocation and stock selection within sectors in an exactly parallel way.) The contribution of each of these components can be found by breaking down the transition from the actual  fund to the fully restrained fund as shown in Table 1.',\n",

The success of the manager’s security selection is measured by compar-  ing the performance of the actual fund with that of the partly restrained fund.  The SIA (1972) report is thus crucial because it introduces the concepts of macro and micro levels of manager decision making and intermediate  notional portfolios to calculate these effects.  In “Investment Performance of Pension Funds” (Holbrook 1977), the British actuary J.P. Holbrook, in effect, pulled together the BAI (1968) report, Fama’s (1972) decomposition, and the SIA (1972) report. This virtu- ally unknown paper provides the foundation for much of the development in performance analysis that followed. Directing his advice to pension fund  trustees, Holbrook defined the decision-making process as follows:  The practical management of a pension fund investment portfolio involves  decisions at three levels.  i) Policy, i.e. the proportions of the assets which, as a long-term aim, the trustees wish to hold in the different investment mar- kets. The fundamental element of policy is the split between equity-type and fixed-interest investments. Definition of pol- icy may extend to a split of equity-type investments between UK equities, overseas equities and properties, specific pro- portions being set for each. If the trustees are not experts in long-term investment, they will tend to formulate policy in discussion with specialist advisers; it is gratifying to record that actuaries who advise on the financing of pension schemes  are increasingly becoming involved in such discussions.  ii) Strategy, i.e. decisions to depart from the policy proportions in the light of current market conditions, including decisions to hold part of the fund on short-term deposit. The trustees will usually seek advice from experts in the various markets regarding the short-term outlook, up to the time of the next investment meeting and over the next year or so. Except where trustees delegate strategic decisions to managers and advisers, investment meetings are usually held at short regular intervals, and arrangements are made for special meetings whenever it is thought that there has been a material change in market prospects. Often trustees authorize the managers concerned to determine the timing of purchases; thus, a manager is able to retain part of the assets entrusted to him in the form of short-',\n",

Performance Attribution  iii) Selection, i.e. the choice of the particular investments to hold, buy or sell within the various markets. Again, practice varies; many trustees give their managers carte blanche in this area—  some keep close control over day-to-day transactions. (p. 20)  Holbrook went on to describe the trustees’ needs. First, they need to know whether the fund performed well, moderately, or badly. This knowledge requires the calculation of return, comparisons with market returns, and con-  sideration of risk:  The performance of the fund as a whole, and within the different markets and sectors, must be examined separately. Secondly, the trustees need to be advised on the reasons for their fund’s performance; this may be inves- tigated by analysing the results to show contributions to total performance made by policy, strategy, and selection decisions. Finally, the trustees need help in interpreting the results as a guide to future action. Identification of points of strength and weakness in past performance may lead to reconsid- eration of policy and practice, of the decision-making process, and possibly  to a change of manager. (p. 21)  To facilitate the breakdown of returns into policy, strategic, and selection  decisions, Holbrook suggested the return calculation of three notional funds:  based on the model, based on the trustees’ policy proportions, and  based on actual allocations.  Then, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by  Then, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by  (8)  The first factor represents the contribution to total performance resulting from the decision to adopt a policy that differs from the equity and fixed- interest proportions in the model [the industry standard allocation between equity and fixed income at the time]. The second, the contribution from the strategic decision to depart from policy proportions. The third, the contribution from selection decisions for the fixed-interest and equity  sectors taken together. (Holbrook 1977, p. 31)  This passage is the first articulation of successive notional portfolios each of which isolates one step in the investment decision process. The fact that it  was written in 1977 shows how far ahead of his time Holbrook was.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The next major development in attribution analysis stems from a series of papers written in the 1980s that collectively describe  Brinson attribution.  Brinson, Hood, and Beebower’s (1986) “Determinants of Portfolio Performance” is perhaps the most well-known paper on attribution. It pro- vided the name for the most common type of equity attribution model used today: the Brinson model. Despite being a relatively short paper, it made two  contributions:  1. The general framework used to decompose total portfolio returns. Brinson et al. (1986) suggested a model for breaking down the arithmetic return in excess of the benchmark (r – b) under the assumption of a standard top-down investment decision process in which the portfolio manager seeks to add value through both timing and security selection. Figure 2 illustrates  their framework for analysing portfolio returns.  Quadrant I represents the policy benchmark return for a period—that is, the return on a hypothetical portfolio wherein the asset-class weights are those in long-term investment policy and the returns are those of the  asset-class benchmarks  .  Quadrant I (9)  Quadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.  Quadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.  In timing, the portfolio manager seeks to add value by holding asset- class (or sector) weights in the portfolio that are different from the asset-class benchmark weights. An asset-class weight in the portfolio that is greater than the benchmark weight for that asset class would be described as overweight and a lesser weight would be described as underweight. Clearly, the portfolio manager will aim to overweight well-performing asset classes (or sectors) and  underweight poorly performing asset classes.  Quadrant II minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-  tracted value from timing only.  10  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.

In security selection, the portfolio manager seeks to add value  by selecting individual securities within the asset class or sector.  Quadrant III minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-  tracted value from selection only.  Quadrant IV represents the actual return of the managed portfolio.  Quadrant IV represents the actual return of the managed portfolio.  Brinson et al. (1986) called the remaining term “other” or the “cross-  product” term. It is now more commonly considered to be “interaction.”  Quadrant IV minus Quadrant III minus Quadrant II plus Quadrant I  represents the added or subtracted value from interaction.  2. In a more controversial practice, the framework is used on a sample of pension funds to demonstrate that most of the difference in returns among pension funds is the result of policy decisions, not timing or selection. This  use of the framework is responsible for much of its fame.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  11  Performance Attribution  Attribution Formulas. Brinson et al. (1986) may be the better known of the “Brinson papers,” but the more important paper in terms of the development of attribution is “Measuring Non-US Equity Portfolio Performance” by Brinson and Fachler (1985). Again, it is a short paper, but it documented for the first time the formulas required to calculate individual',\n",
       " 'attribution effects:  n Allocation (Brinson and Fachler [1985] used the term “market selec-  tion”). The contribution to excess return from asset allocation in the ith sector is  A, =(w, -W.)x(b,-6).  n Selection. The contribution to excess return from stock selection in  sector i is  S,=W,x(r,-4).  n Interaction (Brinson and Fachler used the term “cross-product”). The  contribution to excess return from interaction in sector i is  I, =(w;, -W,)x(7,—4;).  With a few modifications, these formulas provide the basic foundations for most of the attribution analysis used today. The terms “asset allocation,” “security selection,” and “interaction” are now universal and familiar to all. At the time, however, allocation might have been described as “timing,” “market selection,” or “weighting.” To establish when the term “allocation” was first used is difficult, but Cocks (1972) was among the first. He defined it as “all those decisions by which the portfolio manager allocates his funds among the selected securities (or broad classes of securities)” (p. 3). Asset allocation spe- cifically locates the decision process in what asset classes to hold and in what weights, and this terminology is associated with Ibbotson and Sinquefield  (1982), although no one knows when the term was first used.  Use of the term “interaction” (or “other” or “cross-product”) is difficult to establish, but certainly, by the early 1990s, “asset allocation,” “security selec-  tion,” and “interaction” had become the most commonly used terms.  The Brinson et al. (1986) paper did not provide a formula for individual attribution effects, but the following variation of the allocation formula is  associated with that paper:  12  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

(13)  (13)  It seems unlikely that Brinson et al. (1986) intended this interpretation, and the Brinson and Fachler (1985) variant for asset allocation is far more common and better aligned with most investment decision processes. If the Brinson et al. definition is used, the contribution from asset allocation will be positive for any overweight sector in which the sector return is positive, but it will be positive when using the Brinson–Fachler definition only if the sector  return exceeds the overall benchmark return.  Graphically, the Brinson et al. (1986) method is easier to illustrate for each sector i than the Brinson and Fachler (1985) method, as shown in Figure 3. The contribution to portfolio return from sector i is the total area , and the contribution from the benchmark alone is area . In this example the total contribution from the portfolio in sector i is greater than',\n",

In this particular example, , and ;  therefore, all three contributions are positive.  The Brinson and Fachler (1985) method illustrated in Figure 4 is a little less intuitive. As stated in Bacon (2008), “We observe no change to the areas representing selection and interaction but allocation is now described by the  area  ” (p. 125).  Figure 3.

The same formulas as those suggested by Brinson–Fachler and associated with Brinson et al. (1986) can be found in a formal discussion response to a paper by Kingston (1973) presented to the Faculty of Actuaries on 14 October 1974, more than 10 years before the  Brinson–Fachler paper was published.  The formulas may well have been developed prior to the publication of the Brinson and Fachler (1985), Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), Brinson, Singer, and Beebower (1991), and Singer (1996) papers, but collectively these papers established attribution analysis as an important aid in the critical review of active strategies and decision-making processes for asset managers,  asset consultants, and asset owners.  Interaction. Interaction is a controversial effect. Most authors—for example, Laker (2001), Spaulding (2003/2004), Campisi (2004b), and Bacon (2008)—would agree that the interaction effect is a directly calculated term, not a residual, but what does it mean? . . . It is certainly not intuitive. As noted, Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), arguably the first definers of the interaction effect, rather unhelpfully described this effect as “other” or a “cross-product”; they did not use the  term “interaction.” By the early 1990s, the term had become fairly universal  14  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  in the literature, however, probably popularised by the software providers of the time. The interaction effect is clearly a cross-product, the combination of',\n",
       " 'allocation and selection decisions.  Laker (2000) suggested “that when calculated properly, the interaction term plays a valuable role in explaining a portfolio’s active performance, and indeed that sometimes it is clearly more explanatory than the other attributes” (p. 43). Spaulding (2003/2004) was more nuanced in his comments, despite pointing out potentially misleading results (from mispriced securities or investing in sectors not in the benchmark). On balance, Spaulding suggested, it is best to calculate interaction, take the time to do some analysis, and then decide where to assign it, or better yet, show the interaction as a separate item and prepare to explain it. Campisi (2004b) and Bacon (2008) were less supportive of using the interaction effect; they suggested that it is not an active part of the investment decision process and, therefore, need not be calculated. Like many asset managers in practice, they suggested including  interaction in the selection effect.  The decision to include interaction with stock selection is not arbitrary. If you assume that asset allocation decisions are taken first in a top-down investment process, then the attribution from stock selection can be derived from Quadrant IV minus Quadrant II in Figure 2 and interaction need not be calculated at all. The decision to include interaction with stock selection is,  therefore, the direct result of the investment decision process.  The contribution to stock selection in the ith sector is now  The contribution to stock selection in the ith sector is now  S,=w,x(r,-4,),  (14)  (14)  and Figure 4 can now be redrawn as shown in Figure 5 with selection repre-  sented by the area  .  Multiperiod Analysis  The attribution models described so far work well for single periods with static data. No obvious way exists, however, to combine attribution effects over time. Because of the multiplicative (geometric) nature of returns, arithmetic excess returns fail to add up over multiple periods. Carino (1999, p. 5) eloquently  explained the problem this way:  Over multiple periods, the natural way to combine returns is to compound  them. The compounded return R over t periods is  R=(14r)x(+n) xox (Ltn )-1. [15]  [15]  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  15  Performance Attribution',\n",

[16]  [16]  It is clearly unsatisfactory to simply add effects over time, because the sum of return differences does not equal the difference between compounded  returns.  Singer (1996, p. 54) made the same point:  Singer (1996, p. 54) made the same point:  While it is tempting to simply add the individual periods to obtain multipe-  riod attribution results, it is wrong:  [17]  Nor is it satisfactory to compound the single period return differences because  that result does not equal the difference in compounded returns either.

Performance Attribution  Linking and Smoothing. Obviously, if multiperiod arithmetic excess returns do not add up, then clearly arithmetic attribution that adds up for sin- gle periods will not add up for multiple periods. Value added through active management decisions compounds over time, a fact that should be accounted for in multiperiod frameworks. Naturally, the end users of attribution analy-  ses expect their analyses to add up without residuals.  Solutions can be categorized into two types, smoothing algorithms, such as those described by Carino (1999) and Menchero (2000), and linking algorithms (sometimes described as “dollar attribution”), such as those in GRAP (1997),  Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede, Foresti, and Matheos (2002).1  The authors of each paper suggested that their method was the most appropriate to implement. Smoothing algorithms, in effect, take the result- ing residual and methodically redistribute it across other factors. Carino (1999) used logarithms, and Menchero (2000) redistributed the residual in an optimised way that minimised the change in any single factor. GRAP (1997), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002) compounded attribution effects through time and achieved identical results, but cru- cially, their methods are order dependent: If the time periods are reversed, the attribution result will change. Frongello acknowledged the order dependence but regarded it as a strength; others, including Laker (2002),  would describe it as a weakness.  «  Davies and Laker (2001) suggested an “exact” method for using the Brinson model to calculate attributes over multiple periods at a portfolio level, but not sector level. Because of the so-called exact nature of their model, they suggested it would be helpful to evaluate the accuracy of other pro- posed methods by comparison with their method at the total portfolio level. Many articles have been written critiquing and defending existing methods and offering refinements and new methods, including Banchik (2004/2005), Carino (2002), David (2012/2013), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), Jiang and Saenz (2014/2015), Kirievsky and Kirievsky (2000, 2004), Laker (2002, 2005), Menchero (2003), Mirabelli (2000/2001), Reztsov (2011/2012), Spaulding (2002), and Wong (2003/2004, 2007). By and large, however, the end user has proven to be unconcerned about these black box approaches, provided that the multiperiod arithmetic attribution adds up without residu- als. Frongello (2006) concluded that “although the mathematics can differ greatly from one method to another, the story told by the resulting attribution  is the same regardless of the method” (p. 366).  1Software providers have typically found solutions but often keep their methods more or less',\n",

Some would suggest that the problem with multiperiod attribution analysis stems from an incorrect definition of excess return itself. Bacon (2002) defined the arithmetic excess return as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the ini- tial value of the portfolio. That work defined the geometric excess return, , as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the final value of the notional fund. In other words, the geo- metric excess return measures the added value in terms of a percentage of the value of the notional fund assets at the end of the period, not the start, which  is surely the main concern of any asset owner.  Bacon (2002) suggested that geometric excess returns are preferable because they are compoundable (geometric excess returns compound over multiple periods without residuals), they are convertible among currencies, and they are proportionate. The preferred definition of excess return should determine the choice of attribution methodology. Bain (1996), Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998), and Bacon (2002) each presented a geometric attribution model. Although developed independently and presented in dif- ferent ways, the models are, in fact, identical, which is an indication of the robustness of the approach. Geometric models built on the idea of successive notional portfolios can be found in Holbrook (1977), Hymans and Mulligan  (1980), and Allen (1991). As shown in Figure 6, each successive portfolio  Figure 6.

Step I represents the strategic, policy, or benchmark return. The difference between Step II and Step I represents the value added by active asset alloca- tion, and the difference between Step III and Step II represents the value added by security selection. More steps can be introduced for more complex,  multistep investment decision processes.  In the geometric attribution model, the difference between each step is  calculated geometrically:  (19)  Because geometric excess returns compound through time and because geometric allocation effects and geometric selection effects compound together within each period, geometric allocation and geometric selection must also compound through time. Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and  Bacon (2002) provided formulas for individual attribution effects as follows:  n Allocation. The contribution to geometric excess return from asset',\n",

All rights reserved.  19  Performance Attribution  Burnie et al. (1998) described perhaps the most well-known geometric methodology. Interestingly, they made the case for geometric attribution in a single-period context, not necessarily a multiperiod one. They also drew a distinction between top-down and bottom-up investment decision processes. A bottom-up investment decision process, they noted, assumes that security  selection takes precedence over asset allocation or is performed first.  Weber (2018) would consider the Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and Bacon (2002) models to be semi-geometric models. The reason is that although total selection and allocation effects compound to the geometric excess return, the effects within selection and allocation are still arithmeti- cally calculated. Menchero (2001/2002) offered a fully geometric model in  which individual selection and allocation effects compound through time.  Multicurrency Attribution  In this section, we consider three works specifically directed to performance  attribution in currency management.  Allen (1991). In an article entitled “Performance Attribution for Global Equity Portfolios,” Allen took the Holbrook (1977) concept of successive intermediate portfolios and applied it in a multicurrency environment. Allen stated that the trick to quantifying the impact of each type of active manage- ment decision involved calculating the return on a theoretical portfolio where one type of decision had been neutralised. Comparison of the return on the manager’s portfolio (where no decisions had been neutralised) with the return on the portfolio where a class of management decisions had been neutralised  allowed the impact of those neutralised decisions to be measured.  When carried out correctly, this process is quite neat. No unexplained residuals remain. Allen’s article provides a framework for quantifying the marginal impact that both policy decisions and active management decisions have on the performance of a global equity portfolio. At the heart of this framework is the assumption that the total return on an actively managed  global equity portfolio is explained by seven types of decisions:  1. the choice, at the policy level, of the unhedged dollar-denominated index  against which the active equity manager is to be measured  2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country  2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country  3. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based  on the manager’s expectation of the country’s equity returns  4. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based  on the manager’s expectation of the country’s currency returns  20  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

This method allows for evaluation of the long-term contribution of a selected  investment strategy to total return.  Ankrim and Hensel (1992, 1994). In 1992, Ankrim and Hensel pub- lished a Russell Research Commentary setting out a framework for multicur- rency performance attribution. This article, building on work by Brinson and Fachler (1985), separated out the impact of currency decisions—in particular, it recognised the significance of differential interest rates in currency decision  making. Ankrim and Hensel proposed  a method of performance attribution that retains the simplicity and intui- tive appeal of the Brinson and Fachler approach but breaks the returns from currency into two components: one that recognizes the opportunity cost of returns achievable in forward-currency markets and a second that measures the return attributable to the currency being less than fully hedged, both in the portfolio and in the benchmark with which the portfolio is com-  pared. (p. 2)  In the 1992 paper, Ankrim and Hensel identified three reasons that  including currency exposure in performance attribution causes problems:  First, and most obvious, it alters the returns ultimately received by the cli- ent. In Brinson and Fachler [1985], all returns are denominated in the home currency, but this convention makes it impossible to separate the contribu- tion to returns made by the manager’s country and security selection deci-',\n",
       " 'sions from the impact of currency translation gains and losses.  Second, in practice, many portfolios have some portion (but not necessarily all) of their currency exposure hedged away. This requires an approach to performance attribution that allows the proportion of currency exposure  hedged to be variable.  Third, even if a portfolio is completely hedged, the client may choose to  adopt a benchmark that is less than fully hedged. (p. 2)  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  21  Performance Attribution  The authors defined two components of currency return: currency surprise and the forward premium. Currency surprise is uncertain, but the forward premium element is not because it depends on interest rate differentials at the  time of purchase:  Any approach to multicurrency attribution that lumps the forward premium and currency surprise together will credit positive performance to manag- ers who have large exposures in countries with positive forward premiums. Such an approach would penalize managers who hold large positions in  countries with negative forward premiums. (p. 12)  Karnosky and Singer (1994). Arguably the single most important paper published on attribution in the 1990s is Karnosky and Singer. This paper not only demonstrates that managing multicurrency portfolios is sub-optimal if currency is not managed independently but also provides a framework for calculating attribution effects, while critically, taking into account interest rate differentials. Karnosky and Singer resolved the issue of market and currency compounding by using continuously compounded returns in their model, admittedly this is only referred to in the small print, and solved the forward premium concern by thinking in terms of a “return premium” above local interest rates. Karnosky and Singer explained that the term “return premium” is used, rather than the more familiar “risk premium,” to make a subtle distinction in the underlying cash return. “Risk premium” refers to the return of a risky asset in excess of the return of a riskless asset, but in the authors’ analysis, the premiums depend on forward contracts with long maturities, where risk is probably not the dominant factor; hence, the  term “return premium” is used.  Karnosky and Singer’s framework demonstrates that separate currency and market strategies can be implemented within a global portfolio in which a specific currency weight is different from the weight of the associated country market. In effect, the authors applied the standard Brinson methodology twice—once to global portfolios by using local-return premiums (rather than simply local returns) to measure allocation and selection effects and, separately, to cash returns in the base currency of the asset owner in order to  calculate independent currency effects, as shown in Figure 7.  22  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Types of Attribution  Three types of attribution have been identified, and they are characterized by  the information used to calculate attribution effects, as follows:  1. Holdings-based attribution.  1. Holdings-based attribution.  Holdings-based or position-based attribution is calculated by analysing the underlying beginning-period holdings of the portfolio only. Typically, holdings-based attribution is calculated from monthly, weekly, or daily  data, with the shorter time periods leading to greater accuracy.  2. Transaction-based attribution.  2. Transaction-based attribution.  Transaction-based attribution is calculated by using both the holdings of the portfolio and the transactions (purchases and sales) that occurred  during the evaluation period.  Returns-based attribution.  3. Returns-based attribution.  Returns-based (or factor) attribution uses the historical returns of the total portfolio and/or individual securities to decompose the total return into multiple factors. The multifactor model is a regression equation that describes the way a particular security or portfolio reacts to industry sec-  tor, fundamental, macroeconomic, and other market factors.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The type of attribution favoured by the asset manager or asset owner will vary according to the investment decision process, investment objective, quality and availability of data, cost and time considerations, complexity, and reporting objective. Holdings-based and transaction-based attributions are mutually exclusive, and the choice is based on (for holdings based) cost, quality of data, ease of use, and rapid implemen- tation against (for transaction based) the advantages of reconciliation to the client-reported return, completeness, and accuracy. A number of authors— Giguere (2003), Bonafede and McCarthy (2003), Spaulding (2003a), Menchero and Hu (2003), and Bacon (2008)—argued for one approach or another. Spaulding, without an eye to existing software (and thus genuinely independently), concluded that the question “which is better?” does not have a simple answer. Too many variables are at work; in the end, the choice comes down to user preference. In later research, Spaulding (2018) showed that the residual implicit in holdings-based attribution can be extensive and is not nec- essarily correlated with turnover. Both holdings-based and transaction-based attribution are also described as “asset-grouping” or “variance type” attribu- tion, reflecting their requirements for asset allocation data and variance from',\n",

Returns-based attribution, in contrast to the asset-grouping approach, might complement either holdings- or trans- action-based attribution in that it might reveal unexpected biases and make communication easier for asset managers using a factor-focused investment decision process. Returns-based attribution is a direct descendant of Fama (1972) decomposition, which is a single-factor model, via Sharpe (1988) and Fama and French (1993)—both three-factor models that include a general market factor together with a size and value factor—and Carhart (1997), a  four-factor model that introduced a momentum factor.  Amenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:  Amenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:  1. Implicit factor model. In this model, some factor analysis (e.g., a principal components analysis) is performed to statistically extract the factors from  the return’s time series. These factors may not be easily interpretable.  2. Explicit macro factor model. In this approach, macroeconomic variables  are used as factors.  3. Explicit micro factor model. In this approach, microeconomic attributes  are used as factors.  4. Explicit index factor model. In this approach, stock market indexes  (including style subindexes of the market) are used as factors.  24  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Within this framework, Amenc and Le Sourd (2003) described a wide  range of multifactor models in detail.  William F. Sharpe, who is associated with style attribution starting with his 1988 paper (see Sharpe 1988, 1992), used a 12-factor model to determine the passive return of a portfolio with the same style as the active asset man- ager. The difference between the actual portfolio return and the passive return with the same style would be a result of the manager’s selection ability. This type of style analysis provides a natural method for constructing appropriate style benchmarks. Sharpe (1988) stated that the usefulness of the asset-class model depends on the asset classes chosen for implementation. It is desirable',\n",
       " 'that asset classes  e be mutually exclusive,  be mutually exclusive,  e be exhaustive, and  be exhaustive, and  e have returns that differ.  have returns that differ.  Each asset class should be proxied by a market capitalization–weighted index of the securities in it, and no security should be included in more than one asset class. Also, the asset classes should have low correlations with each other (or different standard deviations if correlations are high, as is the case in  many fixed-income styles or asset subclasses).  Surz (1999/2000) suggested a holdings-based or transaction-based form of style attribution based on the exclusive style characteristics of the hold- ings in the portfolio and benchmark. Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2005) proposed a regression-based attribution system linked to the parameters from the “Fundamental Law of Active Management” (Grinold and Kahn 1995, pp. 117–35). In a slight oversimplification, the fundamental law says that alpha is a function of manager skill as well as breadth (the number of inde- pendent bets made by the manager). The investigation by Clarke et al. (2005) indicated that the “law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression- based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise  related to constraints in constructing the portfolio” (p. 81).  Returns-based or regression-based attribution has the following  characteristics:  e It does not necessarily require the composition of the portfolio.

Risk-Adjusted Attribution  Campisi (2000) listed the characteristics of a good performance attribution  system as follows:  • It is consistent with the investment process and the manager’s decision-  making process.  • It uses a benchmark that reflects the manager’s strategic (long-term) asset  allocation.  e It measures the effect of the manager’s tactical (short-term) allocation shifts.  It measures the effect of the manager’s tactical (short-term) allocation shifts.  e It adjusts attribution of return for systematic risk(s).  It adjusts attribution of return for systematic risk(s).  Campisi (2000) suggested that many attribution systems fail at least one of these criteria and some fail all of them. Often, this failure occurs because returns are not adjusted for systematic risk and style (high vs. low beta, large vs. small size, value vs. growth orientation, etc.). Simply applying the alloca- tion/selection model often results in attribution results that are not neces- sarily meaningful because they do not reflect the investment process or the risks that drove return over the evaluation period. Risk-adjusted attribution is the real Cinderella of attribution analysis: In practice, risk-adjusted attri- bution is rarely performed. Ankrim (1992) proposed a form of risk-adjusted attribution using beta, as did Bacon (2008) and Obeid (2005). Kophamel (2003), thinking in terms of the volume of “performance cubes” rather than the familiar “performance areas” of the Brinson model, proposed attribution analysis in three dimensions. Spaulding (2016) suggested adjusting for total risk rather than systematic risk—in effect, attributing M2 returns (described',\n",
       " 'in Modigliani 1997).2 Rather satisfactorily, Fisher and D’Alessandro (2019)  2Modigliani risk-adjusted performance (also known as M2, M2, the Modigliani–Modigliani measure, or RAP) is a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of some investment portfolio. It measures the returns of the portfolio adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of  some benchmark (e.g., the market).  26  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  took attribution full circle and tied risk-adjusted attribution back to the origi-  nal Fama decomposition.  Van Breukelen (2000) suggested a form of risk-adjusted attribution for fixed-income portfolios that takes into account the weighted duration “bets” of portfolio managers. Van Breukelen described a top-down investment deci- sion process in which overall duration is the first decision followed by a mar- ket allocation decision—a combination of country weight and duration—and finally, an issue selection decision within country. Currency effects are mea- sured separately using a Karnosky and Singer (1994) type of approach. The value added by each step of the decision process is measured by using a series  of reference or successive notional portfolios.  Fixed-Income Attribution  The simple Brinson model is widely regarded as being insufficient for all but the simplest of fixed-income investment strategies. McLaren (2002) explained that classical attribution models (e.g., Brinson’s model) are inap- propriate for fixed-income portfolio analysis because the allocation decision in equity models does not explicitly account for yield-curve positioning (dura- tion) set by fixed-income managers. This omission is significant because the duration decision, which has no direct equity counterpart, plays an impor- tant role in the fixed-income decision-making process. Campisi (2000) also explained why fixed income needs its own attribution model and pointed out  five critical differences between stocks and bonds:  1. Bonds are temporary lending agreements with a stated maturity, whereas  stocks are permanent investments.  2. Bonds promise a fixed return, with a strictly defined upside if held to maturity; stocks promise uncertain returns and the unlimited upside (and  downside) associated with ownership.  3. Bonds are typically purchased by institutions, which often hold them until maturity. This pattern results in a limited secondary market for bonds. Stock investing takes place in an active secondary market. As a  result, bonds are illiquid compared with stocks.  4. Bond performance is driven by promised income and by changes in market yields: When market yields rise above a bond’s stated yield, the price of that bond falls. As a result, the relevant risk for bonds is sensitivity to changes in yields. Stock performance is driven by the market’s economic sectors, and the principal risks for stocks are (a) sensitivity to the overall market, or beta,  and (b) the individual fortunes of the company invested in.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  27  Performance Attribution  5. Bonds are simply the promise of a stream of cash flows; thus, they are relatively homogeneous in their pricing. For example, bonds with the same maturity and default risk will generally sell at the same price. Therefore, bonds reflect little selection effect. Stock prices, in contrast, respond dramatically to company-specific conditions and thus reflect a',\n",
       " 'large selection effect.  Distinct approaches for fixed-income attribution emerged quite quickly in the early development of attribution. The method described in Wagner and Tito (1977) is derived directly from Fama decomposition, with beta replaced by a systematic risk measure for bonds—namely, duration. In this approach, fixed-income portfolio performance is driven by promised income and by the  effect that changes in yields have on bond prices.  No single, standardised way of defining fixed-income attribution exists. The asset class has more securities than in equity investing, more types of instruments, more variety in investment process, and more quantitative mod- elling requirements. It also has various ways of describing change in the yield curve and a broad array of investment mandates. Murira and Sierra (2006) explained that each of the commercially available systems uses its own partic- ular brand of return attribution. In fact, because of differences in the defini- tion and computation of the factors, different systems often provide different  values for the same return factor.  Other authors have made various contributions to developments in fixed-income attribution—developments often linked to specific invest- ment decision processes or specific software capabilities. These authors include Ramaswamy (2001), Giguere (2005), Colin (2005, 2014), Gillet and Hommolie (2006), Colin, Cubilie, and Bardoux (2006), Silva, de Carvalho,  and Ornelas (2010), Simmons and Karadakov (2013/2014), and Dias (2017).  Figure 8 illustrates the attribution effects in a typical fixed-income attri- bution model. Here, carry represents the return resulting from the passage of time: coupon payments, accrued interest, and rolling down the yield curve (the  pull-to-par effect as the instrument approaches maturity).  In Figure 8, the yield-curve factor represents the changing shape of the yield curve, parallel shift (the impact of a parallel move of the yield curve), twist (a change in slope of the yield curve), and curvature (change in the curvature of the yield curve). Often, twist and curvature are combined and  described as nonparallel changes in the yield curve or curve reshape.  Spread is the return that comes from the widening or narrowing of credit',\n",

Source: Redrawn from a diagram in Dai and Elliot (2014/2015).  Selection effects include convexity, any optionality in the payment of future coupons (important with mortgage-backed securities because mortgages can be prepaid), and a residual. Normally quite small, residuals are classified by Dias (2017) as caused by the model or caused by data errors and systematic or  random effects.  In the other category, the price effect captures the difference in price sources between the bonds in the portfolio and bonds in the benchmark. This is a nonmanagement effect that is a particular problem for fixed income. The trading effect measures the impact of intraday trading. Currency captures the impact of independent currency management, typically by using a Karnosky  and Singer (1994) type of approach.  Fixed-income attribution models can be characterised as either top-down successive portfolio methods (e.g., Van Breukelen 2000) or bottom-up (yield- curve decomposition) methods. Bottom-up methods calculate the impact of yield-curve movements and credit spreads on individual bonds in both the portfolio and the benchmark and aggregate results. Top-down models are perhaps easier to implement and more effective in terms of communicating to  asset owners and other stakeholders.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  29  Performance Attribution  Gillet and Hommolie (2006) described the bottom-up approach as a suc- cessive spread methodology that can be split into two phases. The first phase consists of decomposing the bond prices into its various characteristics (pas- sage of time, evolution of yield curves, variation of spreads). This decomposi- tion is applied simultaneously to the constituents of the portfolio and to the constituents of the benchmark. The second phase consists only of regrouping the separated elements according to the investment decision process (p. 65). Bottom-up models are more difficult and expensive to implement but more  appropriate to the detailed investment decision processes of the front office.  McLaren (2002) offered a geometric fixed-income attribution model, which is not common. Most fixed-income attribution models are arithme- tic in nature, although for the most part, they can be adapted for geometric analysis. The reason may be that excess returns are typically smaller than in equity investing and the underlying benchmark returns less volatile, mak- ing the difference between geometric and arithmetic excess return smaller in',\n",
       " 'magnitude.  Other Attribution Issues  Other issues in attribution pertain to derivatives, transaction costs, frequency  of the analysis, and application to money-weighted returns.  Derivatives. The Brinson model is an incredibly robust methodology. Stannard (1997), Menchero (2002/2003), Bacon (2008), Fischer and Wermers (2013), and Bacon, Thompson, and van der Westhuizen (2018)—all described, using appropriate notional assets and notional returns, how the standard Brinson model can be adapted to handle derivative instruments, including  index futures, options (of various types), and swaps and short positions.  Transaction Costs. Laker (2001) pointed out that transaction costs— explicit costs (such as brokerage and taxes) and implicit costs (such as the bid–offer spread, market impact, and opportunity cost)—are not dealt with explicitly in most performance attribution methods but are normally included within the stock selection effect. In a bottom-up, security-level attribution approach, Laker suggested using the standard Brinson selection formulas at the security level to calculate the impact of transaction costs (explicit and implicit) and intraday timing effects. He suggested that any return difference between an individual security’s daily return and its return in the index must  be the result of transaction costs and timing within the day.  Frequency of Analysis. DiBartolomeo (2003) challenged the assump-  tion that aggregated daily attribution analysis is more appropriate than  30  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  monthly aggregated analysis and suggested that applying typical attribution methods to daily data draws on assumptions that are highly biased and unre- liable. Beyond simply observing the attributed returns, he believed, you must be able to judge their statistical significance. He suggested that recommend-  ing daily observation rests on four fallacies:  1. Daily performance is economically meaningful. Not necessarily—for example, information is lost by adjusting for the timing of cash flows in',\n",
       " 'time-weighted returns.  2. Daily returns are themselves accurate. Not necessarily—many securities are traded on multiple exchanges or electronic markets at different times, so exactly which closing price is used to compute the daily returns can have a sizable impact. Also, coordinating the timing of corporate actions  such as dividends, spin-offs, and mergers with index providers is difficult.  3. Observations are assumed to be independent. Investment portfolios do not start as a fresh set of management decisions every trading day. Thus the rationale of an independent “start fresh” assumption is weak. Substantial path dependencies are present in portfolio management in practice, which reduces any justification for the assumption of indepen-  dent periodic observations of manager skill.  4. Parametric distributional assumptions are accurate. Most of the aca- demic literature illustrates that the imperfections of our assumptions with respect to quarterly or monthly return data are small, whereas for daily data, we must consistently reject the correctness of the assumptions. In general, daily security returns have fat-tailed distributions, with large return events occurring far more often than would be consistent with a normal distribution. This issue is less of a problem with quarterly or  monthly returns.  DiBartolomeo (2003) concluded that daily performance attribution com- pounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return than attribu- tion using less frequent data—but at a tremendous cost in our ability to judge the statistical significance of the results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in our estimates of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors (believing an estimate is  statistically significant when it is not).  Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003) certainly questioned the ben- efits of more frequent and more detailed performance measurement. They suggested that the cost of daily stock-level attribution is difficult to justify  (although given recent developments in technology their views may have  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  31  Performance Attribution  changed). They suggested that monthly modified Dietz calculations might actually be near the optimum balance and that a simple alternative might be  running actual profit and loss for each position.3  Frongello (2006), in contrast, made the case for daily attribution analysis. He explained that in the real world, risk factor mismatches may occur unin- tentionally—caused by neglect, accidents, or simply changes in the risk pro- file of securities. Performance attribution should seek to explain performance resulting from all risk factor mismatches. Daily attribution is the best method  for monitoring the status and consequence of risk factor mismatches (p. 367).  Zangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) suggested that daily attribution, if done methodically, should produce results that are superior to monthly attri- bution. They pointed out that regardless of the methodology used, what is ultimately critical is the process governing attribution. The five core compo- nents of what they considered to be a good return attribution process are as  follows:  1. Data management and quality control. This task is the most important. Positions, prices, corporate actions, and so on, must be accurately cap-  tured, processed, and incorporated.  2. Infrastructure. Without proper infrastructure (efficient application of',\n",
       " 'hardware and databases), the chance of errors and delays increases.  3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.  3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.  4. Methods. For example; daily buy-and-hold, monthly buy-and-hold, and  transaction-based attribution.  5. Reports. The way in which information is presented is important, so  timely, accurate, and easy-to-understand attribution reports are necessary.  Zangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) concluded that process plays a criti- cal part in determining the accuracy of attribution results. Return attribution should be based on a process that monitors key input data and evaluates attri-  bution results on a daily basis.  Attribution of Money-Weighted Return. For purposes of comparative analysis, most attribution analysis is naturally undertaken on time-weighted rates of return (TWR). Attribution analysis of money-weighted rates of return (MWR) is less common. Yet, attribution analysis of MWR is still  undertaken in the form of the modified Dietz return calculation method.  3The modified Dietz method is a mathematical technique to evaluate a portfolio’s return based on a weighted calculation of its cash flow. The method takes into account the timing of  cash flows and assumes a constant rate of return over a specified period of time.  32  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  It was, in fact, recommended by Menchero and Hu (2003) in the context of transaction-based attribution and by Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003). O’Shea and Jeet (2018) suggested single-period attribution of modified Dietz returns for private equity. Spaulding and Campisi (2007) made the case for money-weighted attribution. They suggested that because cash flow move- ments are a factor that defines the investment process, these cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation system instead of  being neutralised (as occurs in the time-weighted calculation).  The modified Dietz method is a first-order approximation of the internal rate of return (IRR) and, according to Bacon (2007a), an intermediate step in the evolution from calculating IRR (which some might describe as a true MWR) to the true TWR. The IRR is a standard return measure for illiquid asset classes—such as private equity, real estate, and infrastructure—and is common at the total-asset owner level, where comparative analysis is less rel- evant. The modified Dietz method is easy to disaggregate and more straight- forward to attribute than the IRR. Nevertheless, Illmer and Marty (2003) and Illmer (2009) offered a solution to the attribution of the true MWR in',\n",
       " 'terms of both return and profit and loss.  D’Alessandro (2016) suggested analysts should end the debate about which method of return to use, TWR or MWR, and require the presentation  of both with an attribution between the two.  Conclusion: The Evolution of Attribution Methodologies  The evolution of attribution analysis is clear, easy to trace, and illustrated in Figure 9, which maps, not necessarily in chronological order, the major  developments in attribution analysis discussed in this review.  Comparative performance measurement starts with the BAI (1968) study, but attribution analysis itself starts with Fama (1972). From that point, a divergence occurs between asset-grouping and variance-type attribution, with the UK SIA (1972) introducing the concept of selection, allocation, and notional portfolios and return-based attribution developed a little later by Sharpe (1992), Fama and French (1993), Carhart (1997), and many others. Fixed-income attribution naturally veers in a different direction via Wagner and Tito (1977), who replaced beta with duration in the Fama decomposition, and Lord (1997), who responded to the investment decision processes of bond  managers, which are so different from those of equity managers.  Very early, a split occurred between, on the one hand, the dominant arithmetic Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson et al. model (1986) and, on the other hand, the total level geometric approach of Holbrook (1977).

Algorithms started to be published several years after their initial use in Carino (1999), soon followed by GRAP (1997), Menchero (2000), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002). Allen (1991) is a direct link from Holbrook but addressed multicurrency issues. Burnie et al. (1998), together with Bain (1996) and Bacon (2002), developed geometric selection and allocation calcu-  lations that were missing from Holbrook (1977) and from Allen. Ankrim and  34  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Hensel (1992) and, with more success, Karnosky and Singer (1994) adapted the basic Brinson model for multicurrency attribution, including, importantly, taking into account interest rate differentials. Van Breukelen (2000) adapted  the Brinson model for successive portfolio fixed-income attribution.  Figure 9 firmly cements Brinson and Fachler (1985) at the centre of developments in attribution analysis. In more recent years, we have seen many variants of yield-curve decomposition models, which reflects the diver- sity of fixed-income investment decision processes. Because of low uptake, risk-adjusted attribution is not illustrated here but could be represented by a  link between return-based methods and the Brinson model.

The purpose of the BAI study, the starting point for performance analysis, was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds in order to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The report recommended, among other things, the use of market value, not book  value; total return; time-weighted rates of return; and taking risk into account.  Bain, William G. 1996.

Banchik, Sean. 2004/2005. “Pure and Inter-Period Interaction Effects in  Multi-Period Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 9 (2): 53–63.  The author concludes that there is no single correct way to link single- period arithmetic effects to produce multiperiod effects. The appropriate methodology is generally one of personal preference. The most relevant question for the reader is not which method is correct but whether the reader  understands where these effects are included in the chosen methodology.  Bonafede, Julia K., Steven J. Foresti, and Peter Matheos. 2002. “A Multi- Period Linking Algorithm That Has Stood the Test of Time.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 7 (1): 15–26.

Beebower. 1986. “Determinants of Portfolio Performance.” Financial Analysts Journal 42 (4):  39–44.  This extremely well-known paper is important for two reasons. First, it provided the general framework for the decomposition of portfolio return into selection, allocation, and interaction effects (although this last piece is described as “other” in the paper). Second, and more controversially, the paper made the observation that policy decisions make by far the biggest  contribution to the differences in returns among pension funds.

Most attribution models are arithmetically formulated and measure the manager’s “value added”—or the difference between a fund’s return and a passive benchmark return. The authors of this paper contended that such models are prone to error and may produce inconclusive results. This paper illustrates the benefits of using geometric attribution, which defines the “management effect” as the ratio of the fund return factor to the bench-  mark return factor.

The author explains that the drivers of fixed-income performance are fun- damentally different from those of equity portfolios. Bond portfolio per- formance is driven by promised income and by the effect that changes in yields have on bond prices. The author proposes a simple attribution model that provides a straightforward method for identifying the systematic risk',\n",

The proposal in this paper is that although the case is irrefutable for accept- ing the time-weighted return as the preferred method for measuring the return of an asset manager, an equally compelling case can be made for accepting the money-weighted return as the appropriate method for evalu- ating the source of that active return; that is, the money-weighted return is  the correct method for performance attribution.  Campisi, Stephen. 2004b. “Debunking the Interaction Myth.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 8 (4): 63–70.  The author refutes the idea of “interaction” and demonstrates that interac- tion arises from either a poor attribution model or a poor implementation of a sound attribution model. When a sound attribution model is imple- mented correctly, the interaction effect is eliminated. Despite the appearance of mathematical rigor in the calculation of interaction, investors and clients  understand that interaction is not a legitimate part of the investment process.

Their investigation indicates that the law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression-based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise related to constraints in  constructing the portfolio.

The authors discuss the most common ways to describe yield-curve movements: shift, twist, and curvature. Shift is a parallel movement of the curve across all maturities. Twist is a steepening or flattening of the curve, and curvature occurs when a curve becomes more or less humped. The authors suggest an approach to decomposing curve changes that cir- cumvents the difficulties inherent in principal components analysis and  model fitting.  Dai, Tianci, and Mark Elliot. 2014/2015. “Fixed Income Attribution with  Carry Effect.” Journal of Performance Measurement 19 (2): 7–18.  These authors propose a way to capture the true carry return. Typical fixed- income return decompositions attempt to include the carry return, but the return is usually (inadequately) approximated by yield. The authors argue that using an accurate calculation better isolates the effects of yield-curve  shifts, shape, and position; spread changes; and other factors.  42  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

This paper presents four fallacies about daily observation and concludes that daily performance attribution compounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return but at a tremendous cost in the analyst’s ability to judge the statistical significance of results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in estimates  of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors.  Dietz, Peter O. 1966.

This truly seminal paper was the first to suggest decomposing the returns of a portfolio in the manner the author proposes. Fama suggests finer breakdowns of performance than given by the Sharpe, Treynor, or Jensen. For example, methods are presented for distinguishing, on the one hand, the part of an observed return that results from ability to pick the best securities of a given level of risk (“selectivity”) from, on the other hand, the part that is a result of predictions of general market price movements (“timing”). The author also suggests methods for measuring the effects of forgone diversification when an investment manager decides to concentrate  the portfolio’s holdings in what the manager thinks are a few “winners.”  44  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The author provides reflections on a group of practitioners whose objectives were to review the theoretical and methodological aspects of fixed-income attribution and to define best practices. In the context of fixed income, this  group agreed to the following:  • Excess return is generally low; therefore, methodologies must be accu-  rate with small residuals.  The attribution results must match the investment decision process.  • The price differential between the portfolio and the benchmark is not  an effect attributable to the manager.  • The calculation frequency should be as high as possible to avoid distortion.  The group described two types of attribution:  1. Yield-curve decomposition, which breaks down performance into passage of time, yield-curve movements (however described), and spread  variations. This analysis is mostly intended for portfolio managers.  46  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  2.

But if a diversified mix is the alternative, then the impact of departing from this alternative may be no greater than the impact of other decisions, including  security selection.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

This paper focuses on performance attribution as it applies to fixed-income portfolios and indexes. More clearly described as bottom-up contribution analysis of the portfolio compared with its benchmark, this paper emphasizes the requirement for the attribution to be consistent with the investment strategy of the portfolio manager. Income and price returns are calculated separately. Price return is then attributed according to duration, yield-curve distribution, sector allocation, and issue selection. Shift and twist are considered components of duration return; and sector and specific issuer effects are considered components of spread return. Included also are a calendar return (the price return resulting solely from the passage of time) and a residual return (the difference between the actual return and  the model’s estimate of return).  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

In this paper, the author presents an intuitive and robust algorithm for linking single-period attribution effects over time. The method consists of first deducing the correct scaling between the single-period excess returns and the linked excess return and then optimally distributing the residual  among the different time periods.  Menchero, Jose G. 2000/2001. “A Fully Geometric Approach to Performance  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (2): 22–30.  In this paper, the author examines the close relationship between geo- metric and arithmetic calculations and their effects and uses the analogy to arrive at an intuitive mathematical form for attribution analysis. Also, while addressing the issues involved in aggregating the attribution effects  across sectors, the author shows how they can be linked across time.

Menchero, Jose G., and Junmin Hu. 2003. “Errors in Transaction-Based  Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (1): 57–69.  The authors identify three types of transaction-based attribution: true time-weighted methods that use a buy-and-hold assumption and two types of transaction-based attribution based on modified Dietz return calcula- tions. The two latter types are as follows: Type 1, which accounts for exter- nal and internal cash flows, and Type 2, which accounts for internal cash flows only. The authors acknowledge that the holdings-based approach will lead to differences between the actual return and the computed return, but they suggest that the magnitude should be small and typically depend on volatility and portfolio turnover. They suggest that this difference should be attributed to trading effects. The authors show that both Type 1 and Type 2 approaches will lead to attribution errors, so they ultimately prefer  the holdings-based approach.

The author, building on Sharpe (1988), suggests a 12-asset-class model that determines the passive return of a notional portfolio having the same style as the asset manager.

Society of Investment Analysts.  Toward the end of 1970, a working group was set up by the UK Society of Investment Analysts to make recommendations on the subject of portfolio performance measurement for pension funds. The resulting report spe- cifically puts forward methods of calculating portfolio performance, thus  making possible a general comparison of funds.  The approach recommended has two aims: (1) the calculation of a rate of return for comparing funds and (2) the decomposition of the performance of a fund into two components—selection of stocks and selection of sec- tors. This report is, therefore, really the starting point of performance attri- bution because it both defines stock selection and sector allocation (called  “sector selection” in the report) and provides a worked example.

The authors make the case for money-weighted attribution. Since cash flow movements are a factor that defines the investment process, cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation process and should not be neutralised, as they are in a time-weighted calculation. The authors point out that transaction-based attribution methodologies that use modified Dietz calculations are, in fact, money-weighted attributions  over a single period.

This paper demonstrates that a derivatives position can be represented as a series of (normally, two or more) notional asset exposures representing physi- cal securities and any implied borrowing used to finance the security position.

The author states that the arithmetic method produces a distortion when applied to multiple-period attribution because returns naturally compound geometrically, not arithmetically. Nothing can be done to improve the arithmetic method to overcome this basic fact. What is not so well known is that the arithmetic method produces a distortion even for a single period when multiple currencies are involved. In conclusion, the author suggests a  method that is computed geometrically and presented arithmetically.

Hensel, Ezra, and Ilkiw (1991) defined attribution as the “mathemati- cal process of explaining an investment return by relating it to the different risk-taking decisions implicit in the portfolio, and the extent to which each of those risks was rewarded or penalized in the capital markets” (p. 66). Colin (2014) said that the purpose of attribution is to disentangle the fund’s overall  return into the component returns generated by each risk.  In other words, attribution measures which of your investment decisions about the portfolio’s underlying risks worked and which did not. This infor- mation is critical business intelligence for anyone involved in selecting, man- aging, or marketing investments. As the authors noted above, Fischer and Wermers (2013) considered attribution analysis to be the “description and the quantification of key factors on the returns of investment portfolios” (p. 395). DiBartolomeo (2003) considered performance attribution to be the process of disentangling component portions of the observed returns to draw conclu-  sions about the strengths and weaknesses of the investment process.  Note that these definitions are similar. The central question of an attribu- tion analysis is thus the following: To which investment decisions can the active  return of a portfolio relative to its benchmark be traced over a given period?  Formally, Bacon (2008) stated that “performance attribution is a tech- nique used to quantify the excess return of a portfolio against its benchmark into the active decisions of the investment decision process” (p. 117). Murira and Sierra (2006) considered performance attribution the ex post complement  to the ex ante risk decomposition provided by the risk measurement process.  “Performance attribution” is, therefore, perhaps a misleading term: As these descriptions suggest, the excess, active, or relative return is examined,  not the whole of the return (or absolute return). “Relative return attribution”  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  1  Performance Attribution  or simply “attribution analysis” is perhaps better terminology. Absolute attri- bution, or simply contribution analysis, would explain the sources of return of a portfolio in isolation rather than in comparison with a benchmark.  As described in Bacon (2008), attribution analysis is a critical manage- ment tool for several key stakeholders in the asset management process. Above all, it is the main tool for performance analysts because it allows them to ensure that the return is correct. It allows them to participate in the invest- ment decision process by enabling them to demonstrably add value and thus justify their salary and effort. Return attribution, together with risk analy- sis, is the tool that allows the analyst to understand the sources of return in the portfolio and to communicate that understanding to portfolio managers,  senior managers, and asset owners.  Investment management firms themselves, and the portfolio managers they employ, are also major users of attribution analysis. Attribution analy- sis provides a good starting point for a dialogue with asset owners on the positive and negative aspects of recent performance. Attribution analysis can be used aggressively to identify underperformance early and provide clients with a thorough explanation of underperformance and, hopefully, a rationale for improving performance. Attribution analysis is also crucial in gaining the confidence of asset owners by demonstrating a good understanding of the  drivers of performance.  Portfolio managers inhabit the front office of asset management firms; typically, performance analysts inhabit the middle office. The back office is also able to use daily, security-level attribution, however, as a diagnostic tool  for identifying pricing and transaction errors.  Bacon (2008) also stated that “senior management take an active interest in attribution analysis to provide them with a tool to monitor their portfolio managers. They will be keen to identify performance outliers—good or bad—  and to ensure that value is added consistently across the firm” (p. 117).  Hence, attribution analysis has numerous uses across a wide range of asset management stakeholders.  Lord (1997) suggested that the characteristics of a good attribution sys-  tem would include the following:  ¢ aconsistent approach for analysing returns,  a consistent approach for analysing returns,  e asolid theoretical framework for valuation,  a solid theoretical framework for valuation,  e the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,  the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,  attribution factors consistent with decision variables of the portfolio strat-  egy process,  2  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  • summary attribution analysis constructed from security details, which  themselves should be available for inspection,  e transactions, and  transactions, and  • robust analytic systems and high-quality data to provide meaningful  attribution results.  Murira and Sierra (2006) suggested that there is general agreement that  an attribution framework must meet two key requirements:  1. It should be consistent with the investment decision-making process of the portfolio. Performance attribution is most useful if it mirrors the investment management process because, in that case, it enables the iden-  tification and explanation of the sources of excess return.  2. It should be compatible with the organization’s performance measurement and risk measurement systems. Managers would have difficulty making effective use of the information provided by the performance attribution process if the data being explained by this process were inconsistent with  the data originating from the internal risk and performance systems.  As in many literature reviews, here the approach to the task is historical— beginning with the first attempts at performance measurement, about a half-  century ago, and progressing to the present.  Early Development  Arguably, comparative performance measurement began with Dietz’s (1966) Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance and the Bank Administration Institute (BAI 1968) report Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison. The purpose of the BAI study was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The main  conclusions of their study are still relevant:  1. Performance measurement returns should be based on market value, not cost.  Returns should be total returns.  wk  2. Returns should be total returns.  Returns should be time weighted. &  3. Returns should be time weighted.  Performance should include risk as well as return.  4. Performance should include risk as well as return.  Funds should be classified according to their investment objectives.  5. Funds should be classified according to their investment objectives.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Interestingly, Eugene Fama was later invited to write and  wrote the chapter on risk for this report.  Fama Decomposition. Fama was the first to fully delve into the sub- ject of attribution analysis, which he did in “Components of Investment Performance” (Fama 1972). In this seminal paper, Fama suggested breaking down observed return into the part resulting from ability to pick the best securities at a given level of risk (which he at the time called “selectivity”; now, it is often referred to as “selection return”) and the part that is the result of predictions of general market price movements—that is, the return from  systematic risk—as follows:  (1)  Excess  Selectivity  Systematic risk  where:  average portfolio return average market or benchmark return portfolio systematic risk  average risk-free rate  If a portfolio is fully diversified, it incurs no specific risk and the total portfolio risk will equal the systematic risk. Portfolio managers will give up diversification, however, to seek additional return. Therefore, the return from selectivity can be broken down into (1) the additional return required to jus- tify sacrificing a given amount of diversification and (2) the net return from selectivity (the remainder of the manager’s value added). The return from  selectivity is equivalent to Jensen’s alpha,  .  The term “diversification” (used in a different context from the one we would understand today) “is the return required to justify moving away from the benchmark and taking on specific risk” (Bacon 2013, p. 88). To calcu- late this diversification return, you first have to calculate the effective beta required such that systematic risk alone is equivalent to the total portfolio  risk. This beta is the Fama beta, calculated as follows:  B.=—, o  4  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  (2)  Performance Attribution  where: where:  6 = portfolio risk  portfolio risk  6, = benchmark risk  benchmark risk  Therefore, the return required to justify not being fully diversified is cal- culated by using the difference between the Fama beta and the portfolio beta  as follows:  d=(B, -B)x(b-7).  @)  (3)  Note that the “Fama beta will always be greater than or equal to the port- folio beta since total risk is greater than or equal to the systematic risk of the  portfolio” (Bacon 2013, p. 89).  The net return from selectivity (“net selectivity,” for short) is the remain- ing return from selectivity after deducting the amount of return required to  justify not being fully diversified:  Net selectivity = Selectivity — Diversification.  Net selectivity = Selectivity – Diversification.  Net selectivity = Sy,, =a—d.  Net selectivity =  If net selectivity is negative, the portfolio manager has failed to justify the  loss of diversification.  Timing is the return from the manager’s variations in systematic risk  (beta) around some policy or target amount:  (4)  where B, = the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  where  the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  Figure 1 illustrates Fama’s decomposition for portfolio A. represents the return from systematic risk (conventional beta) plus the risk-free rate, and  represents the return from the Fama beta plus the risk-free rate.  Fama’s (1972) “Components of Investment Performance” is the first paper to seriously analyse the sources of return of an investment portfolio and,  therefore, represents the birth of attribution analysis.  Notional Funds. In response to the BAI (1968) paper, a working group was set up towards the end of 1970 by the Society of Investment Analysts  (SIA) in the United Kingdom to make recommendations on the subject  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Its approach, eventually published in 1972 (SIA 1972), had two aims: (1) the determination of a standard method of calculating a portfolio’s return, so that funds could be fairly compared, and (2) the decomposition of the performance of the fund into two components—selection of individual stocks and selection of stock sectors. The first aim is achieved by calculating the time-weighted rate of return using a simple approximation (which later became known as the analyst’s test method and ultimately became redundant as more accurate time-weighted returns became available). The second aim, the analysis of performance, is produced by constructing “notional funds” based on market  indexes and comparing them with actual funds.  This early work dealt with equity-market sectors as the macro level of selection and securities within the sectors as the micro level, but common practice now is to regard asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as the macro level and securities within the asset class as the micro level. Thus, our discussion  will proceed from this latter starting point.  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  e a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  e apartly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  a partly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  Note that the actual fund consists of actual returns and actual weights. The fully restrained fund (sometimes called the “fully notional fund”) represents the return on the policy portfolio—that is, the strategic bench-  mark or policy weights set by the asset owner (represented by the pension  6  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

In  mathematical notation,  b=SW.x5,, i=l  (6)  (5)  where: where:  = weight of the benchmark in the ith asset class (note )  = return of the index in the ith asset class  The partly restrained fund (sometimes called the “semi-notional fund”) represents the intermediate return resulting from the actual weights deter- mined by the manager multiplied by the market index returns.

The actual portfolio return in mathematical notation is  r=) w,Xnr, isl  (7)  where r, is the return of the portfolio assets in the ith asset class.  where is the return of the portfolio assets in the ith asset class.  The performance of a fund—in this case, a pension fund—thus depends on two factors: the selection of asset classes (typically, now described as asset allocation) and the selection of securities within an asset class. (As noted ear- lier, this analysis can also be applied to sector allocation and stock selection within sectors in an exactly parallel way.) The contribution of each of these components can be found by breaking down the transition from the actual  fund to the fully restrained fund as shown in Table 1. Table 1.

Holbrook, in effect, pulled together the BAI (1968) report, Fama’s (1972) decomposition, and the SIA (1972) report. This virtu- ally unknown paper provides the foundation for much of the development in performance analysis that followed. Directing his advice to pension fund  trustees, Holbrook defined the decision-making process as follows:  The practical management of a pension fund investment portfolio involves  decisions at three levels.  i) Policy, i.e. the proportions of the assets which, as a long-term aim, the trustees wish to hold in the different investment mar- kets. The fundamental element of policy is the split between equity-type and fixed-interest investments. Definition of pol- icy may extend to a split of equity-type investments between UK equities, overseas equities and properties, specific pro- portions being set for each. If the trustees are not experts in long-term investment, they will tend to formulate policy in discussion with specialist advisers; it is gratifying to record that actuaries who advise on the financing of pension schemes  are increasingly becoming involved in such discussions.  ii) Strategy, i.e. decisions to depart from the policy proportions in the light of current market conditions, including decisions to hold part of the fund on short-term deposit. The trustees will usually seek advice from experts in the various markets regarding the short-term outlook, up to the time of the next investment meeting and over the next year or so. Except where trustees delegate strategic decisions to managers and advisers, investment meetings are usually held at short regular intervals, and arrangements are made for special meetings whenever it is thought that there has been a material change in market prospects. Often trustees authorize the managers concerned to determine the timing of purchases; thus, a manager is able to retain part of the assets entrusted to him in the form of short- term deposits.  8  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  iii) Selection, i.e. the choice of the particular investments to hold, buy or sell within the various markets. Again, practice varies; many trustees give their managers carte blanche in this area—  some keep close control over day-to-day transactions. (p. 20)  Holbrook went on to describe the trustees’ needs. First, they need to know whether the fund performed well, moderately, or badly. This knowledge requires the calculation of return, comparisons with market returns, and con-  sideration of risk:  The performance of the fund as a whole, and within the different markets and sectors, must be examined separately. Secondly, the trustees need to be advised on the reasons for their fund’s performance; this may be inves- tigated by analysing the results to show contributions to total performance made by policy, strategy, and selection decisions. Finally, the trustees need help in interpreting the results as a guide to future action. Identification of points of strength and weakness in past performance may lead to reconsid- eration of policy and practice, of the decision-making process, and possibly  to a change of manager. (p. 21)  To facilitate the breakdown of returns into policy, strategic, and selection  decisions, Holbrook suggested the return calculation of three notional funds:  based on the model, based on the trustees’ policy proportions, and  based on actual allocations.  Then, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by  Then, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by  (8)  The first factor represents the contribution to total performance resulting from the decision to adopt a policy that differs from the equity and fixed- interest proportions in the model [the industry standard allocation between equity and fixed income at the time]. The second, the contribution from the strategic decision to depart from policy proportions. The third, the contribution from selection decisions for the fixed-interest and equity  sectors taken together. (Holbrook 1977, p. 31)  This passage is the first articulation of successive notional portfolios each of which isolates one step in the investment decision process. The fact that it  was written in 1977 shows how far ahead of his time Holbrook was.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  9  Performance Attribution  Holbrook (1977) linked this successive notional portfolio approach to Fama’s decomposition by equating the first factor to the investor’s return from systematic risk, the second factor to the manager’s return from systematic risk, and the third factor to selectivity.  Foundations  The Brinson Model. The next major development in attribution analysis stems from a series of papers written in the 1980s that collectively describe  Brinson attribution.  Brinson, Hood, and Beebower’s (1986) “Determinants of Portfolio Performance” is perhaps the most well-known paper on attribution. It pro- vided the name for the most common type of equity attribution model used today: the Brinson model. Despite being a relatively short paper, it made two  contributions:  1. The general framework used to decompose total portfolio returns. Brinson et al. (1986) suggested a model for breaking down the arithmetic return in excess of the benchmark (r – b) under the assumption of a standard top-down investment decision process in which the portfolio manager seeks to add value through both timing and security selection. Figure 2 illustrates  their framework for analysing portfolio returns.  Quadrant I represents the policy benchmark return for a period—that is, the return on a hypothetical portfolio wherein the asset-class weights are those in long-term investment policy and the returns are those of the  asset-class benchmarks  .  Quadrant I (9)  Quadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.  Quadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.  In timing, the portfolio manager seeks to add value by holding asset- class (or sector) weights in the portfolio that are different from the asset-class benchmark weights. An asset-class weight in the portfolio that is greater than the benchmark weight for that asset class would be described as overweight and a lesser weight would be described as underweight. Clearly, the portfolio manager will aim to overweight well-performing asset classes (or sectors) and  underweight poorly performing asset classes.  Quadrant II minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-  tracted value from timing only.  10  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.

Quadrant III represents returns resulting from policy and security selec- tion combined. In security selection, the portfolio manager seeks to add value  by selecting individual securities within the asset class or sector.  Quadrant III minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-  tracted value from selection only.  Quadrant IV represents the actual return of the managed portfolio.  Quadrant IV represents the actual return of the managed portfolio.  Brinson et al. (1986) called the remaining term “other” or the “cross-  product” term. It is now more commonly considered to be “interaction.”  Quadrant IV minus Quadrant III minus Quadrant II plus Quadrant I  represents the added or subtracted value from interaction.  2. In a more controversial practice, the framework is used on a sample of pension funds to demonstrate that most of the difference in returns among pension funds is the result of policy decisions, not timing or selection. This  use of the framework is responsible for much of its fame.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  11  Performance Attribution  Attribution Formulas. Brinson et al. (1986) may be the better known of the “Brinson papers,” but the more important paper in terms of the development of attribution is “Measuring Non-US Equity Portfolio Performance” by Brinson and Fachler (1985). Again, it is a short paper, but it documented for the first time the formulas required to calculate individual attribution effects:  n Allocation (Brinson and Fachler [1985] used the term “market selec-  tion”). The contribution to excess return from asset allocation in the ith sector is  A, =(w, -W.)x(b,-6).  n Selection. The contribution to excess return from stock selection in  sector i is  S,=W,x(r,-4).  n Interaction (Brinson and Fachler used the term “cross-product”). The  contribution to excess return from interaction in sector i is  I, =(w;, -W,)x(7,—4;).  With a few modifications, these formulas provide the basic foundations for most of the attribution analysis used today. The terms “asset allocation,” “security selection,” and “interaction” are now universal and familiar to all. At the time, however, allocation might have been described as “timing,” “market selection,” or “weighting.” To establish when the term “allocation” was first used is difficult, but Cocks (1972) was among the first. He defined it as “all those decisions by which the portfolio manager allocates his funds among the selected securities (or broad classes of securities)” (p. 3). Asset allocation spe- cifically locates the decision process in what asset classes to hold and in what weights, and this terminology is associated with Ibbotson and Sinquefield  (1982), although no one knows when the term was first used.  Use of the term “interaction” (or “other” or “cross-product”) is difficult to establish, but certainly, by the early 1990s, “asset allocation,” “security selec-  tion,” and “interaction” had become the most commonly used terms.  The Brinson et al. (1986) paper did not provide a formula for individual attribution effects, but the following variation of the allocation formula is  associated with that paper:  12  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

(13)  (13)  It seems unlikely that Brinson et al. (1986) intended this interpretation, and the Brinson and Fachler (1985) variant for asset allocation is far more common and better aligned with most investment decision processes. If the Brinson et al. definition is used, the contribution from asset allocation will be positive for any overweight sector in which the sector return is positive, but it will be positive when using the Brinson–Fachler definition only if the sector  return exceeds the overall benchmark return.  Graphically, the Brinson et al. (1986) method is easier to illustrate for each sector i than the Brinson and Fachler (1985) method, as shown in Figure 3. The contribution to portfolio return from sector i is the total area , and the contribution from the benchmark alone is area . In this example the total contribution from the portfolio in sector i is greater than the contribution from the benchmark.  The attribution to excess return in sector i is the sum of the areas rep- resenting selection , allocation , and interaction . In this particular example, , and ;  therefore, all three contributions are positive.  The Brinson and Fachler (1985) method illustrated in Figure 4 is a little less intuitive. As stated in Bacon (2008), “We observe no change to the areas representing selection and interaction but allocation is now described by the  area  ” (p. 125).  Figure 3.

The same formulas as those suggested by Brinson–Fachler and associated with Brinson et al. (1986) can be found in a formal discussion response to a paper by Kingston (1973) presented to the Faculty of Actuaries on 14 October 1974, more than 10 years before the  Brinson–Fachler paper was published.  The formulas may well have been developed prior to the publication of the Brinson and Fachler (1985), Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), Brinson, Singer, and Beebower (1991), and Singer (1996) papers, but collectively these papers established attribution analysis as an important aid in the critical review of active strategies and decision-making processes for asset managers,  asset consultants, and asset owners.  Interaction. Interaction is a controversial effect. Most authors—for example, Laker (2001), Spaulding (2003/2004), Campisi (2004b), and Bacon (2008)—would agree that the interaction effect is a directly calculated term, not a residual, but what does it mean? . . . It is certainly not intuitive. As noted, Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), arguably the first definers of the interaction effect, rather unhelpfully described this effect as “other” or a “cross-product”; they did not use the  term “interaction.” By the early 1990s, the term had become fairly universal  14  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  in the literature, however, probably popularised by the software providers of the time. The interaction effect is clearly a cross-product, the combination of allocation and selection decisions.  Laker (2000) suggested “that when calculated properly, the interaction term plays a valuable role in explaining a portfolio’s active performance, and indeed that sometimes it is clearly more explanatory than the other attributes” (p. 43). Spaulding (2003/2004) was more nuanced in his comments, despite pointing out potentially misleading results (from mispriced securities or investing in sectors not in the benchmark). On balance, Spaulding suggested, it is best to calculate interaction, take the time to do some analysis, and then decide where to assign it, or better yet, show the interaction as a separate item and prepare to explain it. Campisi (2004b) and Bacon (2008) were less supportive of using the interaction effect; they suggested that it is not an active part of the investment decision process and, therefore, need not be calculated. Like many asset managers in practice, they suggested including  interaction in the selection effect.  The decision to include interaction with stock selection is not arbitrary. If you assume that asset allocation decisions are taken first in a top-down investment process, then the attribution from stock selection can be derived from Quadrant IV minus Quadrant II in Figure 2 and interaction need not be calculated at all. The decision to include interaction with stock selection is,  therefore, the direct result of the investment decision process.

Multiperiod Analysis  The attribution models described so far work well for single periods with static data. No obvious way exists, however, to combine attribution effects over time. Because of the multiplicative (geometric) nature of returns, arithmetic excess returns fail to add up over multiple periods. Carino (1999, p. 5) eloquently  explained the problem this way:  Over multiple periods, the natural way to combine returns is to compound  them. The compounded return R over t periods is  R=(14r)x(+n) xox (Ltn )-1. [15]  [15]  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  15  Performance Attribution Figure 5.

[16]  [16]  It is clearly unsatisfactory to simply add effects over time, because the sum of return differences does not equal the difference between compounded  returns.  Singer (1996, p. 54) made the same point:  Singer (1996, p. 54) made the same point:  While it is tempting to simply add the individual periods to obtain multipe-  riod attribution results, it is wrong:  [17]  Nor is it satisfactory to compound the single period return differences because  that result does not equal the difference in compounded returns either.

Performance Attribution  Linking and Smoothing. Obviously, if multiperiod arithmetic excess returns do not add up, then clearly arithmetic attribution that adds up for sin- gle periods will not add up for multiple periods. Value added through active management decisions compounds over time, a fact that should be accounted for in multiperiod frameworks. Naturally, the end users of attribution analy-  ses expect their analyses to add up without residuals.  Solutions can be categorized into two types, smoothing algorithms, such as those described by Carino (1999) and Menchero (2000), and linking algorithms (sometimes described as “dollar attribution”), such as those in GRAP (1997),  Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede, Foresti, and Matheos (2002).1  The authors of each paper suggested that their method was the most appropriate to implement. Smoothing algorithms, in effect, take the result- ing residual and methodically redistribute it across other factors. Carino (1999) used logarithms, and Menchero (2000) redistributed the residual in an optimised way that minimised the change in any single factor. GRAP (1997), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002) compounded attribution effects through time and achieved identical results, but cru- cially, their methods are order dependent: If the time periods are reversed, the attribution result will change. Frongello acknowledged the order dependence but regarded it as a strength; others, including Laker (2002),  would describe it as a weakness.  «  Davies and Laker (2001) suggested an “exact” method for using the Brinson model to calculate attributes over multiple periods at a portfolio level, but not sector level. Because of the so-called exact nature of their model, they suggested it would be helpful to evaluate the accuracy of other pro- posed methods by comparison with their method at the total portfolio level. Many articles have been written critiquing and defending existing methods and offering refinements and new methods, including Banchik (2004/2005), Carino (2002), David (2012/2013), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), Jiang and Saenz (2014/2015), Kirievsky and Kirievsky (2000, 2004), Laker (2002, 2005), Menchero (2003), Mirabelli (2000/2001), Reztsov (2011/2012), Spaulding (2002), and Wong (2003/2004, 2007). By and large, however, the end user has proven to be unconcerned about these black box approaches, provided that the multiperiod arithmetic attribution adds up without residu- als. Frongello (2006) concluded that “although the mathematics can differ greatly from one method to another, the story told by the resulting attribution  is the same regardless of the method” (p. 366).  1Software providers have typically found solutions but often keep their methods more or less proprietary.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Some would suggest that the problem with multiperiod attribution analysis stems from an incorrect definition of excess return itself. Bacon (2002) defined the arithmetic excess return as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the ini- tial value of the portfolio. That work defined the geometric excess return, , as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the final value of the notional fund. In other words, the geo- metric excess return measures the added value in terms of a percentage of the value of the notional fund assets at the end of the period, not the start, which  is surely the main concern of any asset owner.  Bacon (2002) suggested that geometric excess returns are preferable because they are compoundable (geometric excess returns compound over multiple periods without residuals), they are convertible among currencies, and they are proportionate. The preferred definition of excess return should determine the choice of attribution methodology. Bain (1996), Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998), and Bacon (2002) each presented a geometric attribution model. Although developed independently and presented in dif- ferent ways, the models are, in fact, identical, which is an indication of the robustness of the approach. Geometric models built on the idea of successive notional portfolios can be found in Holbrook (1977), Hymans and Mulligan  (1980), and Allen (1991).

Step I represents the strategic, policy, or benchmark return. The difference between Step II and Step I represents the value added by active asset alloca- tion, and the difference between Step III and Step II represents the value added by security selection. More steps can be introduced for more complex,  multistep investment decision processes.  In the geometric attribution model, the difference between each step is  calculated geometrically:  (19)  Because geometric excess returns compound through time and because geometric allocation effects and geometric selection effects compound together within each period, geometric allocation and geometric selection must also compound through time. Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and  Bacon (2002) provided formulas for individual attribution effects as follows:  n Allocation. The contribution to geometric excess return from asset allocation in the ith sector  is  (20)  n Selection. The contribution to geometric excess return from stock  selection in sector i  is  (21)  or  or  (22)  In geometric attribution, interaction is typically included in the selection effect, although a geometric interaction effect can be derived if desired (see  Weber 2018).  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  19  Performance Attribution  Burnie et al. (1998) described perhaps the most well-known geometric methodology. Interestingly, they made the case for geometric attribution in a single-period context, not necessarily a multiperiod one. They also drew a distinction between top-down and bottom-up investment decision processes. A bottom-up investment decision process, they noted, assumes that security  selection takes precedence over asset allocation or is performed first.  Weber (2018) would consider the Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and Bacon (2002) models to be semi-geometric models. The reason is that although total selection and allocation effects compound to the geometric excess return, the effects within selection and allocation are still arithmeti- cally calculated. Menchero (2001/2002) offered a fully geometric model in  which individual selection and allocation effects compound through time.  Multicurrency Attribution  In this section, we consider three works specifically directed to performance  attribution in currency management.  Allen (1991). In an article entitled “Performance Attribution for Global Equity Portfolios,” Allen took the Holbrook (1977) concept of successive intermediate portfolios and applied it in a multicurrency environment. Allen stated that the trick to quantifying the impact of each type of active manage- ment decision involved calculating the return on a theoretical portfolio where one type of decision had been neutralised. Comparison of the return on the manager’s portfolio (where no decisions had been neutralised) with the return on the portfolio where a class of management decisions had been neutralised  allowed the impact of those neutralised decisions to be measured.  When carried out correctly, this process is quite neat. No unexplained residuals remain. Allen’s article provides a framework for quantifying the marginal impact that both policy decisions and active management decisions have on the performance of a global equity portfolio. At the heart of this framework is the assumption that the total return on an actively managed  global equity portfolio is explained by seven types of decisions:  1. the choice, at the policy level, of the unhedged dollar-denominated index  against which the active equity manager is to be measured  2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country  2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country  3. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based  on the manager’s expectation of the country’s equity returns  4. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based  on the manager’s expectation of the country’s currency returns  20  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Performance Attribution  5. the timing of purchases and sales of securities (which implicitly affect the currency appreciation of the portfolio)  6. the choice, at the policy level, of the benchmark percentage of the portfo-  lio that is to be hedged passively against currency fluctuation  7. active decisions in the currency forward markets that cause the portfolio’s  return to deviate from that of the passively hedged benchmark  Allen’s article is noteworthy in that despite being based in the United States where arithmetic attribution prevails, he favored a geometric approach because the attribution factors are computed on a multiplicative basis, so they can be “chain-linked” across any time period to generate a cumulative factor. This method allows for evaluation of the long-term contribution of a selected  investment strategy to total return.  Ankrim and Hensel (1992, 1994). In 1992, Ankrim and Hensel pub- lished a Russell Research Commentary setting out a framework for multicur- rency performance attribution. This article, building on work by Brinson and Fachler (1985), separated out the impact of currency decisions—in particular, it recognised the significance of differential interest rates in currency decision  making. Ankrim and Hensel proposed  a method of performance attribution that retains the simplicity and intui- tive appeal of the Brinson and Fachler approach but breaks the returns from currency into two components: one that recognizes the opportunity cost of returns achievable in forward-currency markets and a second that measures the return attributable to the currency being less than fully hedged, both in the portfolio and in the benchmark with which the portfolio is com-  pared. (p. 2)  In the 1992 paper, Ankrim and Hensel identified three reasons that  including currency exposure in performance attribution causes problems:  First, and most obvious, it alters the returns ultimately received by the cli- ent. In Brinson and Fachler [1985], all returns are denominated in the home currency, but this convention makes it impossible to separate the contribu- tion to returns made by the manager’s country and security selection deci- sions from the impact of currency translation gains and losses.  Second, in practice, many portfolios have some portion (but not necessarily all) of their currency exposure hedged away. This requires an approach to performance attribution that allows the proportion of currency exposure  hedged to be variable.  Third, even if a portfolio is completely hedged, the client may choose to  adopt a benchmark that is less than fully hedged. (p. 2)  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  21  Performance Attribution  The authors defined two components of currency return: currency surprise and the forward premium. Currency surprise is uncertain, but the forward premium element is not because it depends on interest rate differentials at the  time of purchase:  Any approach to multicurrency attribution that lumps the forward premium and currency surprise together will credit positive performance to manag- ers who have large exposures in countries with positive forward premiums. Such an approach would penalize managers who hold large positions in  countries with negative forward premiums. (p. 12)  Karnosky and Singer (1994). Arguably the single most important paper published on attribution in the 1990s is Karnosky and Singer. This paper not only demonstrates that managing multicurrency portfolios is sub-optimal if currency is not managed independently but also provides a framework for calculating attribution effects, while critically, taking into account interest rate differentials. Karnosky and Singer resolved the issue of market and currency compounding by using continuously compounded returns in their model, admittedly this is only referred to in the small print, and solved the forward premium concern by thinking in terms of a “return premium” above local interest rates. Karnosky and Singer explained that the term “return premium” is used, rather than the more familiar “risk premium,” to make a subtle distinction in the underlying cash return. “Risk premium” refers to the return of a risky asset in excess of the return of a riskless asset, but in the authors’ analysis, the premiums depend on forward contracts with long maturities, where risk is probably not the dominant factor; hence, the  term “return premium” is used.  Karnosky and Singer’s framework demonstrates that separate currency and market strategies can be implemented within a global portfolio in which a specific currency weight is different from the weight of the associated country market. In effect, the authors applied the standard Brinson methodology twice—once to global portfolios by using local-return premiums (rather than simply local returns) to measure allocation and selection effects and, separately, to cash returns in the base currency of the asset owner in order to  calculate independent currency effects, as shown in Figure 7.  22  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The multifactor model is a regression equation that describes the way a particular security or portfolio reacts to industry sec-  tor, fundamental, macroeconomic, and other market factors.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  23  Performance Attribution  Asset-Grouping Attribution. The type of attribution favoured by the asset manager or asset owner will vary according to the investment decision process, investment objective, quality and availability of data, cost and time considerations, complexity, and reporting objective. Holdings-based and transaction-based attributions are mutually exclusive, and the choice is based on (for holdings based) cost, quality of data, ease of use, and rapid implemen- tation against (for transaction based) the advantages of reconciliation to the client-reported return, completeness, and accuracy. A number of authors— Giguere (2003), Bonafede and McCarthy (2003), Spaulding (2003a), Menchero and Hu (2003), and Bacon (2008)—argued for one approach or another. Spaulding, without an eye to existing software (and thus genuinely independently), concluded that the question “which is better?” does not have a simple answer. Too many variables are at work; in the end, the choice comes down to user preference. In later research, Spaulding (2018) showed that the residual implicit in holdings-based attribution can be extensive and is not nec- essarily correlated with turnover. Both holdings-based and transaction-based attribution are also described as “asset-grouping” or “variance type” attribu- tion, reflecting their requirements for asset allocation data and variance from benchmark data.  Attribution Based on Returns. Returns-based attribution, in contrast to the asset-grouping approach, might complement either holdings- or trans- action-based attribution in that it might reveal unexpected biases and make communication easier for asset managers using a factor-focused investment decision process. Returns-based attribution is a direct descendant of Fama (1972) decomposition, which is a single-factor model, via Sharpe (1988) and Fama and French (1993)—both three-factor models that include a general market factor together with a size and value factor—and Carhart (1997), a  four-factor model that introduced a momentum factor.  Amenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:  Amenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:  1. Implicit factor model. In this model, some factor analysis (e.g., a principal components analysis) is performed to statistically extract the factors from  the return’s time series. These factors may not be easily interpretable.  2. Explicit macro factor model. In this approach, macroeconomic variables  are used as factors.  3. Explicit micro factor model. In this approach, microeconomic attributes  are used as factors.  4. Explicit index factor model. In this approach, stock market indexes  (including style subindexes of the market) are used as factors.  24  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Within this framework, Amenc and Le Sourd (2003) described a wide  range of multifactor models in detail.  William F. Sharpe, who is associated with style attribution starting with his 1988 paper (see Sharpe 1988, 1992), used a 12-factor model to determine the passive return of a portfolio with the same style as the active asset man- ager. The difference between the actual portfolio return and the passive return with the same style would be a result of the manager’s selection ability. This type of style analysis provides a natural method for constructing appropriate style benchmarks. Sharpe (1988) stated that the usefulness of the asset-class model depends on the asset classes chosen for implementation. It is desirable that asset classes  e be mutually exclusive,  be mutually exclusive,  e be exhaustive, and  be exhaustive, and  e have returns that differ.  have returns that differ.  Each asset class should be proxied by a market capitalization–weighted index of the securities in it, and no security should be included in more than one asset class. Also, the asset classes should have low correlations with each other (or different standard deviations if correlations are high, as is the case in  many fixed-income styles or asset subclasses).  Surz (1999/2000) suggested a holdings-based or transaction-based form of style attribution based on the exclusive style characteristics of the hold- ings in the portfolio and benchmark. Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2005) proposed a regression-based attribution system linked to the parameters from the “Fundamental Law of Active Management” (Grinold and Kahn 1995, pp. 117–35). In a slight oversimplification, the fundamental law says that alpha is a function of manager skill as well as breadth (the number of inde- pendent bets made by the manager). The investigation by Clarke et al. (2005) indicated that the “law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression- based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise  related to constraints in constructing the portfolio” (p. 81).  Returns-based or regression-based attribution has the following  characteristics:  e It does not necessarily require the composition of the portfolio.

Risk-Adjusted Attribution  Campisi (2000) listed the characteristics of a good performance attribution  system as follows:  • It is consistent with the investment process and the manager’s decision-  making process.  • It uses a benchmark that reflects the manager’s strategic (long-term) asset  allocation.  e It measures the effect of the manager’s tactical (short-term) allocation shifts.  It measures the effect of the manager’s tactical (short-term) allocation shifts.  e It adjusts attribution of return for systematic risk(s).  It adjusts attribution of return for systematic risk(s).  Campisi (2000) suggested that many attribution systems fail at least one of these criteria and some fail all of them. Often, this failure occurs because returns are not adjusted for systematic risk and style (high vs. low beta, large vs. small size, value vs. growth orientation, etc.). Simply applying the alloca- tion/selection model often results in attribution results that are not neces- sarily meaningful because they do not reflect the investment process or the risks that drove return over the evaluation period. Risk-adjusted attribution is the real Cinderella of attribution analysis: In practice, risk-adjusted attri- bution is rarely performed. Ankrim (1992) proposed a form of risk-adjusted attribution using beta, as did Bacon (2008) and Obeid (2005). Kophamel (2003), thinking in terms of the volume of “performance cubes” rather than the familiar “performance areas” of the Brinson model, proposed attribution analysis in three dimensions. Spaulding (2016) suggested adjusting for total risk rather than systematic risk—in effect, attributing M2 returns (described in Modigliani 1997).2 Rather satisfactorily, Fisher and D’Alessandro (2019)  2Modigliani risk-adjusted performance (also known as M2, M2, the Modigliani–Modigliani measure, or RAP) is a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of some investment portfolio. It measures the returns of the portfolio adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of  some benchmark (e.g., the market).  26  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  took attribution full circle and tied risk-adjusted attribution back to the origi-  nal Fama decomposition.  Van Breukelen (2000) suggested a form of risk-adjusted attribution for fixed-income portfolios that takes into account the weighted duration “bets” of portfolio managers. Van Breukelen described a top-down investment deci- sion process in which overall duration is the first decision followed by a mar- ket allocation decision—a combination of country weight and duration—and finally, an issue selection decision within country. Currency effects are mea- sured separately using a Karnosky and Singer (1994) type of approach. The value added by each step of the decision process is measured by using a series  of reference or successive notional portfolios.  Fixed-Income Attribution  The simple Brinson model is widely regarded as being insufficient for all but the simplest of fixed-income investment strategies. McLaren (2002) explained that classical attribution models (e.g., Brinson’s model) are inap- propriate for fixed-income portfolio analysis because the allocation decision in equity models does not explicitly account for yield-curve positioning (dura- tion) set by fixed-income managers. This omission is significant because the duration decision, which has no direct equity counterpart, plays an impor- tant role in the fixed-income decision-making process. Campisi (2000) also explained why fixed income needs its own attribution model and pointed out  five critical differences between stocks and bonds:  1. Bonds are temporary lending agreements with a stated maturity, whereas  stocks are permanent investments.  2. Bonds promise a fixed return, with a strictly defined upside if held to maturity; stocks promise uncertain returns and the unlimited upside (and  downside) associated with ownership.  3. Bonds are typically purchased by institutions, which often hold them until maturity. This pattern results in a limited secondary market for bonds. Stock investing takes place in an active secondary market. As a  result, bonds are illiquid compared with stocks.  4. Bond performance is driven by promised income and by changes in market yields: When market yields rise above a bond’s stated yield, the price of that bond falls. As a result, the relevant risk for bonds is sensitivity to changes in yields. Stock performance is driven by the market’s economic sectors, and the principal risks for stocks are (a) sensitivity to the overall market, or beta,  and (b) the individual fortunes of the company invested in.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  27  Performance Attribution  5. Bonds are simply the promise of a stream of cash flows; thus, they are relatively homogeneous in their pricing. For example, bonds with the same maturity and default risk will generally sell at the same price. Therefore, bonds reflect little selection effect. Stock prices, in contrast, respond dramatically to company-specific conditions and thus reflect a large selection effect.  Distinct approaches for fixed-income attribution emerged quite quickly in the early development of attribution. The method described in Wagner and Tito (1977) is derived directly from Fama decomposition, with beta replaced by a systematic risk measure for bonds—namely, duration. In this approach, fixed-income portfolio performance is driven by promised income and by the  effect that changes in yields have on bond prices.  No single, standardised way of defining fixed-income attribution exists. The asset class has more securities than in equity investing, more types of instruments, more variety in investment process, and more quantitative mod- elling requirements. It also has various ways of describing change in the yield curve and a broad array of investment mandates. Murira and Sierra (2006) explained that each of the commercially available systems uses its own partic- ular brand of return attribution. In fact, because of differences in the defini- tion and computation of the factors, different systems often provide different  values for the same return factor.  Other authors have made various contributions to developments in fixed-income attribution—developments often linked to specific invest- ment decision processes or specific software capabilities. These authors include Ramaswamy (2001), Giguere (2005), Colin (2005, 2014), Gillet and Hommolie (2006), Colin, Cubilie, and Bardoux (2006), Silva, de Carvalho,  and Ornelas (2010), Simmons and Karadakov (2013/2014), and Dias (2017).  Figure 8 illustrates the attribution effects in a typical fixed-income attri- bution model. Here, carry represents the return resulting from the passage of time: coupon payments, accrued interest, and rolling down the yield curve (the  pull-to-par effect as the instrument approaches maturity).  In Figure 8, the yield-curve factor represents the changing shape of the yield curve, parallel shift (the impact of a parallel move of the yield curve), twist (a change in slope of the yield curve), and curvature (change in the curvature of the yield curve). Often, twist and curvature are combined and  described as nonparallel changes in the yield curve or curve reshape.  Spread is the return that comes from the widening or narrowing of credit spreads.  28  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Figure 8.

Selection effects include convexity, any optionality in the payment of future coupons (important with mortgage-backed securities because mortgages can be prepaid), and a residual. Normally quite small, residuals are classified by Dias (2017) as caused by the model or caused by data errors and systematic or  random effects.  In the other category, the price effect captures the difference in price sources between the bonds in the portfolio and bonds in the benchmark. This is a nonmanagement effect that is a particular problem for fixed income. The trading effect measures the impact of intraday trading. Currency captures the impact of independent currency management, typically by using a Karnosky  and Singer (1994) type of approach.  Fixed-income attribution models can be characterised as either top-down successive portfolio methods (e.g., Van Breukelen 2000) or bottom-up (yield- curve decomposition) methods. Bottom-up methods calculate the impact of yield-curve movements and credit spreads on individual bonds in both the portfolio and the benchmark and aggregate results. Top-down models are perhaps easier to implement and more effective in terms of communicating to  asset owners and other stakeholders.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  29  Performance Attribution  Gillet and Hommolie (2006) described the bottom-up approach as a suc- cessive spread methodology that can be split into two phases. The first phase consists of decomposing the bond prices into its various characteristics (pas- sage of time, evolution of yield curves, variation of spreads). This decomposi- tion is applied simultaneously to the constituents of the portfolio and to the constituents of the benchmark. The second phase consists only of regrouping the separated elements according to the investment decision process (p. 65). Bottom-up models are more difficult and expensive to implement but more  appropriate to the detailed investment decision processes of the front office.  McLaren (2002) offered a geometric fixed-income attribution model, which is not common. Most fixed-income attribution models are arithme- tic in nature, although for the most part, they can be adapted for geometric analysis. The reason may be that excess returns are typically smaller than in equity investing and the underlying benchmark returns less volatile, mak- ing the difference between geometric and arithmetic excess return smaller in magnitude.

Transaction Costs. Laker (2001) pointed out that transaction costs— explicit costs (such as brokerage and taxes) and implicit costs (such as the bid–offer spread, market impact, and opportunity cost)—are not dealt with explicitly in most performance attribution methods but are normally included within the stock selection effect. In a bottom-up, security-level attribution approach, Laker suggested using the standard Brinson selection formulas at the security level to calculate the impact of transaction costs (explicit and implicit) and intraday timing effects. He suggested that any return difference between an individual security’s daily return and its return in the index must  be the result of transaction costs and timing within the day.  Frequency of Analysis. DiBartolomeo (2003) challenged the assump-  tion that aggregated daily attribution analysis is more appropriate than  30  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  monthly aggregated analysis and suggested that applying typical attribution methods to daily data draws on assumptions that are highly biased and unre- liable. Beyond simply observing the attributed returns, he believed, you must be able to judge their statistical significance. He suggested that recommend-  ing daily observation rests on four fallacies:  1. Daily performance is economically meaningful. Not necessarily—for example, information is lost by adjusting for the timing of cash flows in time-weighted returns.  2. Daily returns are themselves accurate. Not necessarily—many securities are traded on multiple exchanges or electronic markets at different times, so exactly which closing price is used to compute the daily returns can have a sizable impact. Also, coordinating the timing of corporate actions  such as dividends, spin-offs, and mergers with index providers is difficult.  3. Observations are assumed to be independent. Investment portfolios do not start as a fresh set of management decisions every trading day. Thus the rationale of an independent “start fresh” assumption is weak. Substantial path dependencies are present in portfolio management in practice, which reduces any justification for the assumption of indepen-  dent periodic observations of manager skill.  4. Parametric distributional assumptions are accurate. Most of the aca- demic literature illustrates that the imperfections of our assumptions with respect to quarterly or monthly return data are small, whereas for daily data, we must consistently reject the correctness of the assumptions. In general, daily security returns have fat-tailed distributions, with large return events occurring far more often than would be consistent with a normal distribution. This issue is less of a problem with quarterly or  monthly returns.  DiBartolomeo (2003) concluded that daily performance attribution com- pounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return than attribu- tion using less frequent data—but at a tremendous cost in our ability to judge the statistical significance of the results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in our estimates of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors (believing an estimate is  statistically significant when it is not).  Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003) certainly questioned the ben- efits of more frequent and more detailed performance measurement. They suggested that the cost of daily stock-level attribution is difficult to justify  (although given recent developments in technology their views may have  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

They suggested that monthly modified Dietz calculations might actually be near the optimum balance and that a simple alternative might be  running actual profit and loss for each position.3  Frongello (2006), in contrast, made the case for daily attribution analysis. He explained that in the real world, risk factor mismatches may occur unin- tentionally—caused by neglect, accidents, or simply changes in the risk pro- file of securities. Performance attribution should seek to explain performance resulting from all risk factor mismatches. Daily attribution is the best method  for monitoring the status and consequence of risk factor mismatches (p. 367).  Zangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) suggested that daily attribution, if done methodically, should produce results that are superior to monthly attri- bution. They pointed out that regardless of the methodology used, what is ultimately critical is the process governing attribution. The five core compo- nents of what they considered to be a good return attribution process are as  follows:  1. Data management and quality control. This task is the most important. Positions, prices, corporate actions, and so on, must be accurately cap-  tured, processed, and incorporated.  2. Infrastructure. Without proper infrastructure (efficient application of hardware and databases), the chance of errors and delays increases.  3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.  3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.  4. Methods. For example; daily buy-and-hold, monthly buy-and-hold, and  transaction-based attribution.  5. Reports. The way in which information is presented is important, so  timely, accurate, and easy-to-understand attribution reports are necessary.  Zangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) concluded that process plays a criti- cal part in determining the accuracy of attribution results. Return attribution should be based on a process that monitors key input data and evaluates attri-  bution results on a daily basis.  Attribution of Money-Weighted Return. For purposes of comparative analysis, most attribution analysis is naturally undertaken on time-weighted rates of return (TWR). Attribution analysis of money-weighted rates of return (MWR) is less common. Yet, attribution analysis of MWR is still  undertaken in the form of the modified Dietz return calculation method.  3The modified Dietz method is a mathematical technique to evaluate a portfolio’s return based on a weighted calculation of its cash flow. The method takes into account the timing of  cash flows and assumes a constant rate of return over a specified period of time.  32  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  It was, in fact, recommended by Menchero and Hu (2003) in the context of transaction-based attribution and by Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003). O’Shea and Jeet (2018) suggested single-period attribution of modified Dietz returns for private equity. Spaulding and Campisi (2007) made the case for money-weighted attribution. They suggested that because cash flow move- ments are a factor that defines the investment process, these cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation system instead of  being neutralised (as occurs in the time-weighted calculation).  The modified Dietz method is a first-order approximation of the internal rate of return (IRR) and, according to Bacon (2007a), an intermediate step in the evolution from calculating IRR (which some might describe as a true MWR) to the true TWR. The IRR is a standard return measure for illiquid asset classes—such as private equity, real estate, and infrastructure—and is common at the total-asset owner level, where comparative analysis is less rel- evant. The modified Dietz method is easy to disaggregate and more straight- forward to attribute than the IRR. Nevertheless, Illmer and Marty (2003) and Illmer (2009) offered a solution to the attribution of the true MWR in terms of both return and profit and loss.  D’Alessandro (2016) suggested analysts should end the debate about which method of return to use, TWR or MWR, and require the presentation  of both with an attribution between the two.  Conclusion: The Evolution of Attribution Methodologies  The evolution of attribution analysis is clear, easy to trace, and illustrated in Figure 9, which maps, not necessarily in chronological order, the major  developments in attribution analysis discussed in this review.  Comparative performance measurement starts with the BAI (1968) study, but attribution analysis itself starts with Fama (1972). From that point, a divergence occurs between asset-grouping and variance-type attribution, with the UK SIA (1972) introducing the concept of selection, allocation, and notional portfolios and return-based attribution developed a little later by Sharpe (1992), Fama and French (1993), Carhart (1997), and many others. Fixed-income attribution naturally veers in a different direction via Wagner and Tito (1977), who replaced beta with duration in the Fama decomposition, and Lord (1997), who responded to the investment decision processes of bond  managers, which are so different from those of equity managers.  Very early, a split occurred between, on the one hand, the dominant arithmetic Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson et al. model (1986) and, on the other hand, the total level geometric approach of Holbrook (1977).  Smoothing and linking algorithms were soon needed in order for multiperiod  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  33  Performance Attribution  Figure 9.

Algorithms started to be published several years after their initial use in Carino (1999), soon followed by GRAP (1997), Menchero (2000), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002). Allen (1991) is a direct link from Holbrook but addressed multicurrency issues. Burnie et al. (1998), together with Bain (1996) and Bacon (2002), developed geometric selection and allocation calcu-  lations that were missing from Holbrook (1977) and from Allen. Ankrim and  34  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Hensel (1992) and, with more success, Karnosky and Singer (1994) adapted the basic Brinson model for multicurrency attribution, including, importantly, taking into account interest rate differentials. Van Breukelen (2000) adapted  the Brinson model for successive portfolio fixed-income attribution.  Figure 9 firmly cements Brinson and Fachler (1985) at the centre of developments in attribution analysis. In more recent years, we have seen many variants of yield-curve decomposition models, which reflects the diver- sity of fixed-income investment decision processes. Because of low uptake, risk-adjusted attribution is not illustrated here but could be represented by a  link between return-based methods and the Brinson model.

This article provides a framework for quantifying the marginal impact that both policy decisions and active management decisions have on the per- formance of a global equity portfolio. The article is noteworthy because, influenced by currency effects, it represents an early US-based example of geometric or multiplicative attribution; it emphasises the value of “no  unexplained residuals” and attribution factors that “chain-link.”  Amenc, Noel, and Veronique Le Sourd. 2003.

Ankrim, Ernest M. 1992. “Risk-Adjusted Performance Attribution.”  Financial Analysts Journal 48 (2): 75–82.  The author suggests that classical attribution analysis does not consider risk and posits that in general, such methods will tend to overreward risky managers and underreward conservative ones. The author proposes an  attribution approach that adjusts for the systematic risk of each sector.  Ankrim, Ernest M., and Chris R.

The author explains that the choice of an arithmetic or geometric attribution method is really a choice between using arithmetic or geometric excess return, and he expresses a preference for geometric excess returns based on compoundability, convertibility, and proportionality.

Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the  Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison. Bank Administration Institute.  The purpose of the BAI study, the starting point for performance analysis, was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds in order to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The report recommended, among other things, the use of market value, not book  value; total return; time-weighted rates of return; and taking risk into account.  Bain, William G. 1996. Investment Performance Measurement. Woodhead Publishing.  This book is, for the most part, concerned with the measurement and anal- ysis of pension fund investment portfolios. Most notable is its description of the WM Company’s multiplicative (or geometric) attribution methodol-  ogy (pp. 65–74).  Banchik, Sean. 2004/2005. “Pure and Inter-Period Interaction Effects in  Multi-Period Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 9 (2): 53–63.  The author concludes that there is no single correct way to link single- period arithmetic effects to produce multiperiod effects. The appropriate methodology is generally one of personal preference. The most relevant question for the reader is not which method is correct but whether the reader  understands where these effects are included in the chosen methodology.  Bonafede, Julia K., Steven J. Foresti, and Peter Matheos. 2002. “A Multi- Period Linking Algorithm That Has Stood the Test of Time.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 7 (1): 15–26.  The authors introduce a linking algorithm for multiperiod arithmetic attri- bution. The method was in use from the early 1980s, but this description  was not published until 2002.

Only buy-and-hold returns are consistent with benchmarking needs; therefore, performance attribution for portfolio management should use holdings-based return analysis. The authors propose an additional term called “trading” to explain the  difference.  Brinson, Gary P., and Nimrod Fachler. 1985. “Measuring Non-US Equity  Portfolio Performance.” Journal of Portfolio Management 11 (3): 73–76.  This hugely important paper documented, for the first time, selection and allocation formulas at the sector level. The paper helped lend “Brinson” to the name of the most commonly used attribution model.  Brinson, Gary P., L. Randolph Hood, Jr., and Gilbert L. Beebower. 1986. “Determinants of Portfolio Performance.” Financial Analysts Journal 42 (4):  39–44.  This extremely well-known paper is important for two reasons. First, it provided the general framework for the decomposition of portfolio return into selection, allocation, and interaction effects (although this last piece is described as “other” in the paper). Second, and more controversially, the paper made the observation that policy decisions make by far the biggest  contribution to the differences in returns among pension funds.  Brinson, Gary P., Brian D. Singer, and Gilbert L. Beebower. 1991. “Determinants of Portfolio Performance II: An Update.” Financial Analysts  Journal 47 (3): 40–48.

Most attribution models are arithmetically formulated and measure the manager’s “value added”—or the difference between a fund’s return and a passive benchmark return. The authors of this paper contended that such models are prone to error and may produce inconclusive results. This paper illustrates the benefits of using geometric attribution, which defines the “management effect” as the ratio of the fund return factor to the bench-  mark return factor.

Campisi, Stephen. 2000. “Primer on Fixed Income Performance Attribution.”  Journal of Performance Measurement 4 (4): 14–25.  The author explains that the drivers of fixed-income performance are fun- damentally different from those of equity portfolios. Bond portfolio per- formance is driven by promised income and by the effect that changes in yields have on bond prices. The author proposes a simple attribution model that provides a straightforward method for identifying the systematic risk and stylistic factors of the asset manager’s strategy.  Campisi, Stephen. 2004a. “The Case for Money-Weighted Performance  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (3): 31–41.  The proposal in this paper is that although the case is irrefutable for accept- ing the time-weighted return as the preferred method for measuring the return of an asset manager, an equally compelling case can be made for accepting the money-weighted return as the appropriate method for evalu- ating the source of that active return; that is, the money-weighted return is  the correct method for performance attribution.  Campisi, Stephen. 2004b. “Debunking the Interaction Myth.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 8 (4): 63–70.  The author refutes the idea of “interaction” and demonstrates that interac- tion arises from either a poor attribution model or a poor implementation of a sound attribution model. When a sound attribution model is imple- mented correctly, the interaction effect is eliminated. Despite the appearance of mathematical rigor in the calculation of interaction, investors and clients  understand that interaction is not a legitimate part of the investment process.

Second, the assessment of an asset allocation decision should consider the actual returns connected to that decision. Third, excess return decomposition should exclude the  impact of overlapping issue-level positions.  Carhart, Mark M. 1997. “On Persistence in Mutual Fund Performance.” Journal of Finance 52 (1): 57–82.

This paper discloses Frank Russell Company’s method of combining attribution effects over time and displaying results in an additive man- ner. The paper is important in that it is the first time a software firm pub- lished its method for linking multiple-period attribution results without residuals, thus encouraging other firms to publish their in-house linking  methodologies.  Carino, David R. 2002. “Refinements in Multi-Period Attribution.” Journal  of Performance Measurement 7 (1): 45–53.  The author offers a derivation of the dollar family of linking algorithms (see Frongello 2002a, 2002b; GRAP 1997; and Bonafede, Foresti, and Matheos 2002) and discusses further refinements whilst cautioning the  performance analyst to balance complexity against practicality.  Clarke, Roger, Harindra de Silva, and Steven Thorley. 2005. “Performance  Attribution and the Fundamental Law.” Financial Analysts Journal 61 (5): 70–83.  The authors propose a regression-based attribution system linked to the parameters from the “Fundamental Law of Active Management” (Grinold and Kahn 1995). Their investigation indicates that the law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression-based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise related to constraints in  constructing the portfolio.

The objective of performance analysis should be to measure the various elements of performance that reflect the decisions involved in the investment process. The author then suggests that investment decisions may be classified in two ways: selection and allocation. This paper is one of  the first to use the term “allocation.”  Colin, Andrew M. 2005.

Colin, Andrew M., Mathieu Cubilie, and Frederic Bardoux. 2006. “A New Approach to the Decomposition of Yield Curve Movements for Fixed Income  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 10 (4): 18–28.  The authors discuss the most common ways to describe yield-curve movements: shift, twist, and curvature. Shift is a parallel movement of the curve across all maturities. Twist is a steepening or flattening of the curve, and curvature occurs when a curve becomes more or less humped. The authors suggest an approach to decomposing curve changes that cir- cumvents the difficulties inherent in principal components analysis and  model fitting.  Dai, Tianci, and Mark Elliot. 2014/2015. “Fixed Income Attribution with  Carry Effect.” Journal of Performance Measurement 19 (2): 7–18.  These authors propose a way to capture the true carry return. Typical fixed- income return decompositions attempt to include the carry return, but the return is usually (inadequately) approximated by yield. The authors argue that using an accurate calculation better isolates the effects of yield-curve  shifts, shape, and position; spread changes; and other factors.  42  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

DiBartolomeo, Dan. 2003. “Just Because We Can Doesn’t Mean We Should.”  Journal of Performance Measurement 7 (3): 30–36.  This paper presents four fallacies about daily observation and concludes that daily performance attribution compounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return but at a tremendous cost in the analyst’s ability to judge the statistical significance of results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in estimates  of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors.  Dietz, Peter O. 1966. Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance. Graduate School of Business of Columbia University and Free Press.  This book fired the starting gun for comparative performance measure- ment and established the dominance of time-weighted rate of return as the measure.

Fama, Eugene F. 1972. “Components of Investment Performance.” Journal of  Finance 28 (3): 551–67.  This truly seminal paper was the first to suggest decomposing the returns of a portfolio in the manner the author proposes. Fama suggests finer breakdowns of performance than given by the Sharpe, Treynor, or Jensen. For example, methods are presented for distinguishing, on the one hand, the part of an observed return that results from ability to pick the best securities of a given level of risk (“selectivity”) from, on the other hand, the part that is a result of predictions of general market price movements (“timing”). The author also suggests methods for measuring the effects of forgone diversification when an investment manager decides to concentrate  the portfolio’s holdings in what the manager thinks are a few “winners.”  44  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

This article proposes a risk-adjusted performance attribution analysis that integrates risk measures with the Brinson models of attribution. The ben- efit is that it allows analysts to decompose the excess portfolio return into components of risk allocation, selection, and net selectivity that are addi-  tive and consistent with financial theory.

Giguere, Claude. 2005. “Thinking through Fixed Income Attribution— Reflections from a Group of French Practitioners.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 9 (4): 46–65.  The author provides reflections on a group of practitioners whose objectives were to review the theoretical and methodological aspects of fixed-income attribution and to define best practices. In the context of fixed income, this  group agreed to the following:  • Excess return is generally low; therefore, methodologies must be accu-  rate with small residuals.  The attribution results must match the investment decision process.  • The price differential between the portfolio and the benchmark is not  an effect attributable to the manager.  • The calculation frequency should be as high as possible to avoid distortion.  The group described two types of attribution:  1. Yield-curve decomposition, which breaks down performance into passage of time, yield-curve movements (however described), and spread  variations. This analysis is mostly intended for portfolio managers.  46  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  2. Exposure decomposition, a top-down approach based on intermediate reference portfolios. It can be better understood by noninvestment professionals than yield-curve decomposition and is useful when  explaining the source of added value.

Building on the work of Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), the authors suggest that if US T-bills are the appropriate naive alternative for US investors, then asset allocation away from T-bills is, as commonly thought, the single decision with the greatest impact on an investor’s return. But if a diversified mix is the alternative, then the impact of departing from this alternative may be no greater than the impact of other decisions, including  security selection.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

This important paper pulls together the work of the BAI (1968), Fama (1972), and the Society of Investment Analysts (SIA 1972). The article establishes the importance of investment objectives, the nature of liabilities, the need for investment policies, and the responsibilities of trustees. Crucially, the author decomposes the decision-making process into policy decisions, strategy deci- sions, and selection. Holbrook suggests the use of notional funds for each step of the decision process and establishes a geometric relationship for the  value added (or subtracted) at each step of the process.

The most important work written on performance attribution in the 1990s, this book develops an analytical framework for evaluating global asset markets and uses that framework to construct a performance attribution system that isolates the effects of market allocation, currency management,  and security selection on global portfolios.  This book is important for demonstrating that a multinational portfolio is suboptimally managed if currency is not managed independently and for demonstrating the importance of interest rate differentials between  currencies.

Laker, Damian. 2000. “What Is This Thing Called ‘Interaction’?” Journal of  Performance Measurement 5 (1): 43–57.  In this paper, the author suggests that the interaction term has a bad reputation. He states that portfolio managers do not distinguish between interaction and error terms but arbitrarily add them to other terms. As a  result, they find interaction difficult to explain to clients.  The author argues that the interaction term is sometimes more explanatory than the other attributes and that attempts to avoid confusion by “getting rid of ” the interaction term in a Brinson model are, in fact, likely to create  more confusion.  Laker, Damian. 2001. “Incorporating Transaction Cost Measurement into  Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (4): 13–24.  This paper points out that transaction costs (explicit costs, such as brokerage  and taxes, and implicit costs, such as the bid–offer spread, market impact,  50  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The author suggests a stock-level, bottom-up style of attribution approach that identifies and separates the impact of intraday timing and transaction costs.  Laker, Damian. 2002. “A View from Down-Under.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 6 (4): 5–13.

The author defines transaction-based attribution, holdings-based attribu- tion, and transaction-based attribution that identifies transaction costs, and he provides worked examples of each. The paper explains that the simplicity, reduced number of calculations, and reduced data burden of  holdings-based attribution come at the cost of accuracy.  Laker, Damian. 2005. “Toward Consensus on Multiple-Period Arithmetic  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 9 (3): 26–37.

Lord, Timothy J. 1997. “The Attribution of Portfolio and Index Returns in  Fixed Income.” Journal of Performance Measurement 2 (1): 45–57.  This paper focuses on performance attribution as it applies to fixed-income portfolios and indexes. More clearly described as bottom-up contribution analysis of the portfolio compared with its benchmark, this paper emphasizes the requirement for the attribution to be consistent with the investment strategy of the portfolio manager. Income and price returns are calculated separately. Price return is then attributed according to duration, yield-curve distribution, sector allocation, and issue selection. Shift and twist are considered components of duration return; and sector and specific issuer effects are considered components of spread return. Included also are a calendar return (the price return resulting solely from the passage of time) and a residual return (the difference between the actual return and  the model’s estimate of return).  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Menchero, Jose G. 2000. “An Optimized Approach to Linking Attribution  Effects over Time.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (1): 36–42.  In this paper, the author presents an intuitive and robust algorithm for linking single-period attribution effects over time. The method consists of first deducing the correct scaling between the single-period excess returns and the linked excess return and then optimally distributing the residual  among the different time periods.  Menchero, Jose G. 2000/2001. “A Fully Geometric Approach to Performance  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (2): 22–30.  In this paper, the author examines the close relationship between geo- metric and arithmetic calculations and their effects and uses the analogy to arrive at an intuitive mathematical form for attribution analysis. Also, while addressing the issues involved in aggregating the attribution effects  across sectors, the author shows how they can be linked across time.

Menchero, Jose G., and Junmin Hu. 2003. “Errors in Transaction-Based  Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (1): 57–69.  The authors identify three types of transaction-based attribution: true time-weighted methods that use a buy-and-hold assumption and two types of transaction-based attribution based on modified Dietz return calcula- tions. The two latter types are as follows: Type 1, which accounts for exter- nal and internal cash flows, and Type 2, which accounts for internal cash flows only. The authors acknowledge that the holdings-based approach will lead to differences between the actual return and the computed return, but they suggest that the magnitude should be small and typically depend on volatility and portfolio turnover. They suggest that this difference should be attributed to trading effects. The authors show that both Type 1 and Type 2 approaches will lead to attribution errors, so they ultimately prefer  the holdings-based approach.

Sharpe describes the returns as leaving “tracks in the sand” that can be interpreted, by using regression analysis, as  style exposures.  Sharpe, William F. 1992. “Asset Allocation: Management Style and  Performance Measurement.” Journal of Portfolio Management 18 (2): 7–19.  The author, building on Sharpe (1988), suggests a 12-asset-class model that determines the passive return of a notional portfolio having the same style as the asset manager. The manager’s selection return is the difference  between the actual return and the passive return in the same style.  SIA. 1972. The Measurement of Portfolio Performance for Pension Funds.  Society of Investment Analysts.  Toward the end of 1970, a working group was set up by the UK Society of Investment Analysts to make recommendations on the subject of portfolio performance measurement for pension funds. The resulting report spe- cifically puts forward methods of calculating portfolio performance, thus  making possible a general comparison of funds.  The approach recommended has two aims: (1) the calculation of a rate of return for comparing funds and (2) the decomposition of the performance of a fund into two components—selection of stocks and selection of sec- tors. This report is, therefore, really the starting point of performance attri- bution because it both defines stock selection and sector allocation (called  “sector selection” in the report) and provides a worked example.

Despite pointing out potentially misleading results caused by calculating interaction (for example, mispriced securities and/or investing in sectors not in the benchmark), the author determines that on balance, it is better to calculate interaction, take the time to do some analysis, and then decide where to assign it—better yet would be to  show the interaction as a separate item and prepare to explain it.

Some firms’ trading volumes are such that a simple buy-and-hold model will not provide even the remotest degree of precision. But how much more must a firm spend? And for many  firms, any incremental benefit can be justified by the added cost.  Spaulding, David. 2003b. Investment Performance Attribution. McGraw-Hill.  Spaulding, David. 2003b. Investment Performance Attribution. McGraw-Hill.  The book is the first devoted solely to the subject of performance attribution. Spaulding, David. 2003/2004. “Demystifying the Interaction Effect.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (2): 49–54.  The author explains that the interaction effect is the product of two deci- sions: selection and allocation. Despite pointing out potentially misleading results caused by calculating interaction (for example, mispriced securities and/or investing in sectors not in the benchmark), the author determines that on balance, it is better to calculate interaction, take the time to do some analysis, and then decide where to assign it—better yet would be to  show the interaction as a separate item and prepare to explain it.  Spaulding, David. 2016. “Performance Attribution Risk-Adjusted: Why It Makes Sense and How to Do It.” Journal of Performance Measurement 20 (4):  42–56.  This paper briefly reviews various risk-adjusted attribution methodologies and suggests a simple methodology based on M2 (the Modigliani and  Modigliani risk-adjusted performance measure).  56  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Performance Attribution  Spaulding, David. 2018. “Transaction- vs. Holdings-Based Attribution: The Differences Are Not So Clear but Quite Important.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 22 (3): 49–76.  In this detailed study, the author finds that the residuals caused by holdings-based analysis can be extensive and are not necessarily correlated  with turnover, as might be expected.  Spaulding, David, and Stephen Campisi. 2007. “A Case for Money-Weighted Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 11 (Performance Attribution  Supplement: 8–20.  The authors make the case for money-weighted attribution. Since cash flow movements are a factor that defines the investment process, cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation process and should not be neutralised, as they are in a time-weighted calculation. The authors point out that transaction-based attribution methodologies that use modified Dietz calculations are, in fact, money-weighted attributions  over a single period.  Stannard, John C. 1997. “Measuring Investment Returns of Portfolios Containing Derivatives: Part II—Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 1 (3): 5–9.  This paper demonstrates that a derivatives position can be represented as a series of (normally, two or more) notional asset exposures representing physi- cal securities and any implied borrowing used to finance the security position. Standard performance attribution techniques can be used on notional assets  to represent the derivatives in terms of the underlying investment decisions.  Surz, Ronald J. 1999/2000. “Attribution with Style.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 4 (2): 50–64.  This paper makes the case that manager style is a powerful determinant of performance. Style-based attribution produces much more reliable indicators than sector-based methods because most investment managers manage to a style rather than to some mix of economic sectors. Using sector-  based attribution analysis can produce significantly misleading inferences.  Van Breukelen, Gerard. 2000. “Fixed Income Attribution.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 4 (4): 61–68.  This article discusses performance attribution for fixed-income portfolios. The starting point is a top-down decision structure, which means that the  portfolio’s overall duration is decided first, followed by the distribution  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  57  Performance Attribution  over markets. The risk factor for markets is a combination of weight and duration. After the market allocation, individual issue selection is  measured. Currency allocation is independent and measured separately.  Wagner, Wayne H., and Dennis A. Tito. 1977. “Definitive New Measures of  Bond Performance and Risk.” Pension World (May): 17–26.  This article is an early attempt to analyse fixed-income portfolios in a man-  ner similar to Fama (1972) decomposition but replacing beta with duration.  Weber, Arno. 2018. “Geometric Attribution and the Interaction Effect.”  Journal of Performance Measurement 22 (4): 6–19.  The author presents a variant of the Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998)  model that includes interaction effects.  Wong, Celia. 2003/2004. “Attribution—Arithmetic or Geometric? The Best of Both Worlds.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (2): 10–18.  The author lists the pros and cons of the arithmetic and geometric methods and concludes the geometric method is clearly superior in almost every way. The author states that the arithmetic method produces a distortion when applied to multiple-period attribution because returns naturally compound geometrically, not arithmetically. Nothing can be done to improve the arithmetic method to overcome this basic fact. What is not so well known is that the arithmetic method produces a distortion even for a single period when multiple currencies are involved. In conclusion, the author suggests a  method that is computed geometrically and presented arithmetically.  Wong, Celia. 2007. “Comparing Arithmetic and Geometric Attribution.” In Advanced Portfolio Attribution Analysis, edited by Carl Bacon, 135–59. Risk  Books.  The author provides a new arithmetic formula that eliminates the drawbacks of multiperiod arithmetic attribution with no need for linking algorithms. She also presents an easy way of converting between arithmetic and geometric attribution so that expressing attribution results is just a  matter of preference.  Zangari, Peter J., and Mehmet Bayraktar. 2005/2006. “Which Is Better: Daily  or Monthly Attribution?” Journal of Performance Measurement 10 (2): 8–19.  This article explores important issues in the debate about the merits of daily versus monthly attribution and concludes that daily attribution, if done  methodically, should produce results that are superior to monthly attribution.  58  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Hensel, Ezra, and Ilkiw (1991) defined attribution as the “mathemati- cal process of explaining an investment return by relating it to the different risk-taking decisions implicit in the portfolio, and the extent to which each of those risks was rewarded or penalized in the capital markets” (p. 66). Colin (2014) said that the purpose of attribution is to disentangle the fund’s overall  return into the component returns generated by each risk.  In other words, attribution measures which of your investment decisions about the portfolio’s underlying risks worked and which did not. This infor- mation is critical business intelligence for anyone involved in selecting, man- aging, or marketing investments. As the authors noted above, Fischer and Wermers (2013) considered attribution analysis to be the “description and the quantification of key factors on the returns of investment portfolios” (p. 395). DiBartolomeo (2003) considered performance attribution to be the process of disentangling component portions of the observed returns to draw conclu-  sions about the strengths and weaknesses of the investment process.  Note that these definitions are similar. The central question of an attribu- tion analysis is thus the following: To which investment decisions can the active  return of a portfolio relative to its benchmark be traced over a given period?  Formally, Bacon (2008) stated that “performance attribution is a tech- nique used to quantify the excess return of a portfolio against its benchmark into the active decisions of the investment decision process” (p. 117). Murira and Sierra (2006) considered performance attribution the ex post complement  to the ex ante risk decomposition provided by the risk measurement process.  “Performance attribution” is, therefore, perhaps a misleading term: As these descriptions suggest, the excess, active, or relative return is examined,  not the whole of the return (or absolute return). “Relative return attribution”  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Absolute attri- bution, or simply contribution analysis, would explain the sources of return of a portfolio in isolation rather than in comparison with a benchmark.  As described in Bacon (2008), attribution analysis is a critical manage- ment tool for several key stakeholders in the asset management process. Above all, it is the main tool for performance analysts because it allows them to ensure that the return is correct. It allows them to participate in the invest- ment decision process by enabling them to demonstrably add value and thus justify their salary and effort. Return attribution, together with risk analy- sis, is the tool that allows the analyst to understand the sources of return in the portfolio and to communicate that understanding to portfolio managers,  senior managers, and asset owners.  Investment management firms themselves, and the portfolio managers they employ, are also major users of attribution analysis. Attribution analy- sis provides a good starting point for a dialogue with asset owners on the positive and negative aspects of recent performance. Attribution analysis can be used aggressively to identify underperformance early and provide clients with a thorough explanation of underperformance and, hopefully, a rationale for improving performance. Attribution analysis is also crucial in gaining the confidence of asset owners by demonstrating a good understanding of the  drivers of performance.  Portfolio managers inhabit the front office of asset management firms; typically, performance analysts inhabit the middle office. The back office is also able to use daily, security-level attribution, however, as a diagnostic tool  for identifying pricing and transaction errors.  Bacon (2008) also stated that “senior management take an active interest in attribution analysis to provide them with a tool to monitor their portfolio managers. They will be keen to identify performance outliers—good or bad—  and to ensure that value is added consistently across the firm” (p. 117).  Hence, attribution analysis has numerous uses across a wide range of asset management stakeholders.  Lord (1997) suggested that the characteristics of a good attribution sys-  tem would include the following:  ¢ aconsistent approach for analysing returns,  a consistent approach for analysing returns,  e asolid theoretical framework for valuation,  a solid theoretical framework for valuation,  e the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,  the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,  attribution factors consistent with decision variables of the portfolio strat-  egy process,  2  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Performance Attribution  • summary attribution analysis constructed from security details, which  themselves should be available for inspection,  e transactions, and  transactions, and  • robust analytic systems and high-quality data to provide meaningful  attribution results.  Murira and Sierra (2006) suggested that there is general agreement that  an attribution framework must meet two key requirements:  1. It should be consistent with the investment decision-making process of the portfolio. Performance attribution is most useful if it mirrors the investment management process because, in that case, it enables the iden-  tification and explanation of the sources of excess return.  2. It should be compatible with the organization’s performance measurement and risk measurement systems. Managers would have difficulty making effective use of the information provided by the performance attribution process if the data being explained by this process were inconsistent with  the data originating from the internal risk and performance systems.  As in many literature reviews, here the approach to the task is historical— beginning with the first attempts at performance measurement, about a half-  century ago, and progressing to the present.  Early Development  Arguably, comparative performance measurement began with Dietz’s (1966) Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance and the Bank Administration Institute (BAI 1968) report Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison. The purpose of the BAI study was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The main  conclusions of their study are still relevant:  1. Performance measurement returns should be based on market value, not cost.  Returns should be total returns.  wk  2. Returns should be total returns.  Returns should be time weighted. &  3. Returns should be time weighted.  Performance should include risk as well as return.  4. Performance should include risk as well as return.  Funds should be classified according to their investment objectives.  5. Funds should be classified according to their investment objectives.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  3  Performance Attribution  Although the report did not recommend the use of attribution analysis— instead, emphasizing the importance of the total return of the portfolio—it did suggest that comparison of various sector returns within the portfolio might be useful. Interestingly, Eugene Fama was later invited to write and  wrote the chapter on risk for this report.  Fama Decomposition. Fama was the first to fully delve into the sub- ject of attribution analysis, which he did in “Components of Investment Performance” (Fama 1972). In this seminal paper, Fama suggested breaking down observed return into the part resulting from ability to pick the best securities at a given level of risk (which he at the time called “selectivity”; now, it is often referred to as “selection return”) and the part that is the result of predictions of general market price movements—that is, the return from  systematic risk—as follows:  (1)  Excess  Selectivity  Systematic risk  where:  average portfolio return average market or benchmark return portfolio systematic risk  average risk-free rate  If a portfolio is fully diversified, it incurs no specific risk and the total portfolio risk will equal the systematic risk. Portfolio managers will give up diversification, however, to seek additional return. Therefore, the return from selectivity can be broken down into (1) the additional return required to jus- tify sacrificing a given amount of diversification and (2) the net return from selectivity (the remainder of the manager’s value added). The return from  selectivity is equivalent to Jensen’s alpha,  .  The term “diversification” (used in a different context from the one we would understand today) “is the return required to justify moving away from the benchmark and taking on specific risk” (Bacon 2013, p. 88). To calcu- late this diversification return, you first have to calculate the effective beta required such that systematic risk alone is equivalent to the total portfolio  risk. This beta is the Fama beta, calculated as follows:  B.=—, o  4  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  (2)  Performance Attribution  where: where:  6 = portfolio risk  portfolio risk  6, = benchmark risk  benchmark risk  Therefore, the return required to justify not being fully diversified is cal- culated by using the difference between the Fama beta and the portfolio beta  as follows:  d=(B, -B)x(b-7).  @)  (3)  Note that the “Fama beta will always be greater than or equal to the port- folio beta since total risk is greater than or equal to the systematic risk of the  portfolio” (Bacon 2013, p. 89).  The net return from selectivity (“net selectivity,” for short) is the remain- ing return from selectivity after deducting the amount of return required to  justify not being fully diversified:  Net selectivity = Selectivity — Diversification.  Net selectivity = Selectivity – Diversification.  Net selectivity = Sy,, =a—d.  Net selectivity =  If net selectivity is negative, the portfolio manager has failed to justify the  loss of diversification.  Timing is the return from the manager’s variations in systematic risk  (beta) around some policy or target amount:  (4)  where B, = the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  where  the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  Figure 1 illustrates Fama’s decomposition for portfolio A. represents the return from systematic risk (conventional beta) plus the risk-free rate, and  represents the return from the Fama beta plus the risk-free rate.  Fama’s (1972) “Components of Investment Performance” is the first paper to seriously analyse the sources of return of an investment portfolio and,  therefore, represents the birth of attribution analysis.  Notional Funds. In response to the BAI (1968) paper, a working group was set up towards the end of 1970 by the Society of Investment Analysts  (SIA) in the United Kingdom to make recommendations on the subject  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Its approach, eventually published in 1972 (SIA 1972), had two aims: (1) the determination of a standard method of calculating a portfolio’s return, so that funds could be fairly compared, and (2) the decomposition of the performance of the fund into two components—selection of individual stocks and selection of stock sectors. The first aim is achieved by calculating the time-weighted rate of return using a simple approximation (which later became known as the analyst’s test method and ultimately became redundant as more accurate time-weighted returns became available). The second aim, the analysis of performance, is produced by constructing “notional funds” based on market  indexes and comparing them with actual funds.  This early work dealt with equity-market sectors as the macro level of selection and securities within the sectors as the micro level, but common practice now is to regard asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as the macro level and securities within the asset class as the micro level. Thus, our discussion  will proceed from this latter starting point.  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  e a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  e apartly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  a partly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  Note that the actual fund consists of actual returns and actual weights. The fully restrained fund (sometimes called the “fully notional fund”) represents the return on the policy portfolio—that is, the strategic bench-  mark or policy weights set by the asset owner (represented by the pension  6  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

In  mathematical notation,  b=SW.x5,, i=l  (6)  (5)  where: where:  = weight of the benchmark in the ith asset class (note )  = return of the index in the ith asset class  The partly restrained fund (sometimes called the “semi-notional fund”) represents the intermediate return resulting from the actual weights deter- mined by the manager multiplied by the market index returns. Again, in  mathematical notation,  b, => w, xb, i=1  (6)  (6)  where is the weight of the portfolio in the ith asset class (note ).  The actual portfolio return in mathematical notation is  r=) w,Xnr, isl  (7)  where r, is the return of the portfolio assets in the ith asset class.  where is the return of the portfolio assets in the ith asset class.  The performance of a fund—in this case, a pension fund—thus depends on two factors: the selection of asset classes (typically, now described as asset allocation) and the selection of securities within an asset class. (As noted ear- lier, this analysis can also be applied to sector allocation and stock selection within sectors in an exactly parallel way.) The contribution of each of these components can be found by breaking down the transition from the actual  fund to the fully restrained fund as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Source of Profit/Loss  Selection of asset classes (asset allocation)  Partly restrained fund minus fully restrained fund  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  7  Performance Attribution  The success of the manager’s asset allocation is measured by comparing the performance of the partly restrained fund with that of the fully restrained fund. The success of the manager’s security selection is measured by compar-  ing the performance of the actual fund with that of the partly restrained fund.  The SIA (1972) report is thus crucial because it introduces the concepts of macro and micro levels of manager decision making and intermediate  notional portfolios to calculate these effects.  In “Investment Performance of Pension Funds” (Holbrook 1977), the British actuary J.P. Holbrook, in effect, pulled together the BAI (1968) report, Fama’s (1972) decomposition, and the SIA (1972) report. This virtu- ally unknown paper provides the foundation for much of the development in performance analysis that followed. Directing his advice to pension fund  trustees, Holbrook defined the decision-making process as follows:  The practical management of a pension fund investment portfolio involves',\n",
       " 'decisions at three levels.  i) Policy, i.e. the proportions of the assets which, as a long-term aim, the trustees wish to hold in the different investment mar- kets. The fundamental element of policy is the split between equity-type and fixed-interest investments. Definition of pol- icy may extend to a split of equity-type investments between UK equities, overseas equities and properties, specific pro- portions being set for each. If the trustees are not experts in long-term investment, they will tend to formulate policy in discussion with specialist advisers; it is gratifying to record that actuaries who advise on the financing of pension schemes  are increasingly becoming involved in such discussions.  ii) Strategy, i.e. decisions to depart from the policy proportions in the light of current market conditions, including decisions to hold part of the fund on short-term deposit. The trustees will usually seek advice from experts in the various markets regarding the short-term outlook, up to the time of the next investment meeting and over the next year or so. Except where trustees delegate strategic decisions to managers and advisers, investment meetings are usually held at short regular intervals, and arrangements are made for special meetings whenever it is thought that there has been a material change in market prospects. Often trustees authorize the managers concerned to determine the timing of purchases; thus, a manager is able to retain part of the assets entrusted to him in the form of short- term deposits.  8  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  iii) Selection, i.e. the choice of the particular investments to hold, buy or sell within the various markets. Again, practice varies; many trustees give their managers carte blanche in this area—  some keep close control over day-to-day transactions. (p. 20)  Holbrook went on to describe the trustees’ needs. First, they need to know whether the fund performed well, moderately, or badly. This knowledge requires the calculation of return, comparisons with market returns, and con-  sideration of risk:  The performance of the fund as a whole, and within the different markets and sectors, must be examined separately. Secondly, the trustees need to be advised on the reasons for their fund’s performance; this may be inves- tigated by analysing the results to show contributions to total performance made by policy, strategy, and selection decisions. Finally, the trustees need help in interpreting the results as a guide to future action. Identification of points of strength and weakness in past performance may lead to reconsid- eration of policy and practice, of the decision-making process, and possibly  to a change of manager. (p. 21)  To facilitate the breakdown of returns into policy, strategic, and selection  decisions, Holbrook suggested the return calculation of three notional funds:  based on the model, based on the trustees’ policy proportions, and  based on actual allocations.  Then, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by  Then, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by  (8)  The first factor represents the contribution to total performance resulting from the decision to adopt a policy that differs from the equity and fixed- interest proportions in the model [the industry standard allocation between equity and fixed income at the time]. The second, the contribution from the strategic decision to depart from policy proportions. The third, the contribution from selection decisions for the fixed-interest and equity  sectors taken together. (Holbrook 1977, p. 31)  This passage is the first articulation of successive notional portfolios each of which isolates one step in the investment decision process. The fact that it  was written in 1977 shows how far ahead of his time Holbrook was.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  9  Performance Attribution  Holbrook (1977) linked this successive notional portfolio approach to Fama’s decomposition by equating the first factor to the investor’s return from systematic risk, the second factor to the manager’s return from systematic risk, and the third factor to selectivity.  Foundations  The Brinson Model. The next major development in attribution analysis stems from a series of papers written in the 1980s that collectively describe  Brinson attribution.  Brinson, Hood, and Beebower’s (1986) “Determinants of Portfolio Performance” is perhaps the most well-known paper on attribution. It pro- vided the name for the most common type of equity attribution model used today: the Brinson model. Despite being a relatively short paper, it made two  contributions:  1. The general framework used to decompose total portfolio returns. Brinson et al. (1986) suggested a model for breaking down the arithmetic return in excess of the benchmark (r – b) under the assumption of a standard top-down investment decision process in which the portfolio manager seeks to add value through both timing and security selection. Figure 2 illustrates  their framework for analysing portfolio returns.  Quadrant I represents the policy benchmark return for a period—that is, the return on a hypothetical portfolio wherein the asset-class weights are those in long-term investment policy and the returns are those of the  asset-class benchmarks  .  Quadrant I (9)  Quadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.  Quadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.  In timing, the portfolio manager seeks to add value by holding asset- class (or sector) weights in the portfolio that are different from the asset-class benchmark weights. An asset-class weight in the portfolio that is greater than the benchmark weight for that asset class would be described as overweight and a lesser weight would be described as underweight. Clearly, the portfolio manager will aim to overweight well-performing asset classes (or sectors) and  underweight poorly performing asset classes.  Quadrant II minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-  tracted value from timing only.  10  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution Figure 2. The Brinson Quadrants  Selection  Actual  Actual  Passive Excess returns due to: Total  IV – I  Source: Brinson et al. (1986).  Source: Brinson et al. (1986).  Quadrant III represents returns resulting from policy and security selec- tion combined. In security selection, the portfolio manager seeks to add value  by selecting individual securities within the asset class or sector.  Quadrant III minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-  tracted value from selection only.  Quadrant IV represents the actual return of the managed portfolio.  Quadrant IV represents the actual return of the managed portfolio.  Brinson et al. (1986) called the remaining term “other” or the “cross-  product” term. It is now more commonly considered to be “interaction.”  Quadrant IV minus Quadrant III minus Quadrant II plus Quadrant I  represents the added or subtracted value from interaction.  2. In a more controversial practice, the framework is used on a sample of pension funds to demonstrate that most of the difference in returns among pension funds is the result of policy decisions, not timing or selection. This  use of the framework is responsible for much of its fame.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  11  Performance Attribution  Attribution Formulas. Brinson et al. (1986) may be the better known of the “Brinson papers,” but the more important paper in terms of the development of attribution is “Measuring Non-US Equity Portfolio Performance” by Brinson and Fachler (1985). Again, it is a short paper, but it documented for the first time the formulas required to calculate individual attribution effects:  n Allocation (Brinson and Fachler [1985] used the term “market selec-  tion”). The contribution to excess return from asset allocation in the ith sector is  A, =(w, -W.)x(b,-6).  n Selection. The contribution to excess return from stock selection in  sector i is  S,=W,x(r,-4).  n Interaction (Brinson and Fachler used the term “cross-product”). The  contribution to excess return from interaction in sector i is  I, =(w;, -W,)x(7,—4;).  With a few modifications, these formulas provide the basic foundations for most of the attribution analysis used today. The terms “asset allocation,” “security selection,” and “interaction” are now universal and familiar to all. At the time, however, allocation might have been described as “timing,” “market selection,” or “weighting.” To establish when the term “allocation” was first used is difficult, but Cocks (1972) was among the first. He defined it as “all those decisions by which the portfolio manager allocates his funds among the selected securities (or broad classes of securities)” (p. 3). Asset allocation spe- cifically locates the decision process in what asset classes to hold and in what weights, and this terminology is associated with Ibbotson and Sinquefield  (1982), although no one knows when the term was first used.  Use of the term “interaction” (or “other” or “cross-product”) is difficult to establish, but certainly, by the early 1990s, “asset allocation,” “security selec-  tion,” and “interaction” had become the most commonly used terms.  The Brinson et al. (1986) paper did not provide a formula for individual attribution effects, but the following variation of the allocation formula is  associated with that paper:  12  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

(13)  (13)  It seems unlikely that Brinson et al. (1986) intended this interpretation, and the Brinson and Fachler (1985) variant for asset allocation is far more common and better aligned with most investment decision processes. If the Brinson et al. definition is used, the contribution from asset allocation will be positive for any overweight sector in which the sector return is positive, but it will be positive when using the Brinson–Fachler definition only if the sector  return exceeds the overall benchmark return.  Graphically, the Brinson et al. (1986) method is easier to illustrate for each sector i than the Brinson and Fachler (1985) method, as shown in Figure 3. The contribution to portfolio return from sector i is the total area , and the contribution from the benchmark alone is area . In this example the total contribution from the portfolio in sector i is greater than the contribution from the benchmark.  The attribution to excess return in sector i is the sum of the areas rep- resenting selection , allocation , and interaction . In this particular example, , and ;  therefore, all three contributions are positive.  The Brinson and Fachler (1985) method illustrated in Figure 4 is a little less intuitive. As stated in Bacon (2008), “We observe no change to the areas representing selection and interaction but allocation is now described by the  area  ” (p. 125).  Figure 3.

The same formulas as those suggested by Brinson–Fachler and associated with Brinson et al. (1986) can be found in a formal discussion response to a paper by Kingston (1973) presented to the Faculty of Actuaries on 14 October 1974, more than 10 years before the  Brinson–Fachler paper was published.  The formulas may well have been developed prior to the publication of the Brinson and Fachler (1985), Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), Brinson, Singer, and Beebower (1991), and Singer (1996) papers, but collectively these papers established attribution analysis as an important aid in the critical review of active strategies and decision-making processes for asset managers,  asset consultants, and asset owners.  Interaction. Interaction is a controversial effect. Most authors—for example, Laker (2001), Spaulding (2003/2004), Campisi (2004b), and Bacon (2008)—would agree that the interaction effect is a directly calculated term, not a residual, but what does it mean? . . . It is certainly not intuitive. As noted, Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), arguably the first definers of the interaction effect, rather unhelpfully described this effect as “other” or a “cross-product”; they did not use the  term “interaction.” By the early 1990s, the term had become fairly universal  14  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  in the literature, however, probably popularised by the software providers of the time. The interaction effect is clearly a cross-product, the combination of allocation and selection decisions.  Laker (2000) suggested “that when calculated properly, the interaction term plays a valuable role in explaining a portfolio’s active performance, and indeed that sometimes it is clearly more explanatory than the other attributes” (p. 43). Spaulding (2003/2004) was more nuanced in his comments, despite pointing out potentially misleading results (from mispriced securities or investing in sectors not in the benchmark). On balance, Spaulding suggested, it is best to calculate interaction, take the time to do some analysis, and then decide where to assign it, or better yet, show the interaction as a separate item and prepare to explain it. Campisi (2004b) and Bacon (2008) were less supportive of using the interaction effect; they suggested that it is not an active part of the investment decision process and, therefore, need not be calculated. Like many asset managers in practice, they suggested including  interaction in the selection effect.  The decision to include interaction with stock selection is not arbitrary. If you assume that asset allocation decisions are taken first in a top-down investment process, then the attribution from stock selection can be derived from Quadrant IV minus Quadrant II in Figure 2 and interaction need not be calculated at all. The decision to include interaction with stock selection is,  therefore, the direct result of the investment decision process.  The contribution to stock selection in the ith sector is now  The contribution to stock selection in the ith sector is now  S,=w,x(r,-4,),  (14)  (14)  and Figure 4 can now be redrawn as shown in Figure 5 with selection repre-  sented by the area  .  Multiperiod Analysis  The attribution models described so far work well for single periods with static data. No obvious way exists, however, to combine attribution effects over time. Because of the multiplicative (geometric) nature of returns, arithmetic excess returns fail to add up over multiple periods. Carino (1999, p. 5) eloquently  explained the problem this way:  Over multiple periods, the natural way to combine returns is to compound  them. The compounded return R over t periods is  R=(14r)x(+n) xox (Ltn )-1. [15]  [15]  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  15  Performance Attribution Figure 5.

[16]  [16]  It is clearly unsatisfactory to simply add effects over time, because the sum of return differences does not equal the difference between compounded  returns.  Singer (1996, p. 54) made the same point:  Singer (1996, p. 54) made the same point:  While it is tempting to simply add the individual periods to obtain multipe-  riod attribution results, it is wrong:  [17]  Nor is it satisfactory to compound the single period return differences because  that result does not equal the difference in compounded returns either.

Performance Attribution  Linking and Smoothing. Obviously, if multiperiod arithmetic excess returns do not add up, then clearly arithmetic attribution that adds up for sin- gle periods will not add up for multiple periods. Value added through active management decisions compounds over time, a fact that should be accounted for in multiperiod frameworks. Naturally, the end users of attribution analy-  ses expect their analyses to add up without residuals.',\n",
       " 'Solutions can be categorized into two types, smoothing algorithms, such as those described by Carino (1999) and Menchero (2000), and linking algorithms (sometimes described as “dollar attribution”), such as those in GRAP (1997),  Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede, Foresti, and Matheos (2002).1  The authors of each paper suggested that their method was the most appropriate to implement. Smoothing algorithms, in effect, take the result- ing residual and methodically redistribute it across other factors. Carino (1999) used logarithms, and Menchero (2000) redistributed the residual in an optimised way that minimised the change in any single factor. GRAP (1997), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002) compounded attribution effects through time and achieved identical results, but cru- cially, their methods are order dependent: If the time periods are reversed, the attribution result will change. Frongello acknowledged the order dependence but regarded it as a strength; others, including Laker (2002),  would describe it as a weakness.  «  Davies and Laker (2001) suggested an “exact” method for using the Brinson model to calculate attributes over multiple periods at a portfolio level, but not sector level. Because of the so-called exact nature of their model, they suggested it would be helpful to evaluate the accuracy of other pro- posed methods by comparison with their method at the total portfolio level. Many articles have been written critiquing and defending existing methods and offering refinements and new methods, including Banchik (2004/2005), Carino (2002), David (2012/2013), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), Jiang and Saenz (2014/2015), Kirievsky and Kirievsky (2000, 2004), Laker (2002, 2005), Menchero (2003), Mirabelli (2000/2001), Reztsov (2011/2012), Spaulding (2002), and Wong (2003/2004, 2007). By and large, however, the end user has proven to be unconcerned about these black box approaches, provided that the multiperiod arithmetic attribution adds up without residu- als. Frongello (2006) concluded that “although the mathematics can differ greatly from one method to another, the story told by the resulting attribution  is the same regardless of the method” (p. 366).  1Software providers have typically found solutions but often keep their methods more or less proprietary.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Some would suggest that the problem with multiperiod attribution analysis stems from an incorrect definition of excess return itself. Bacon (2002) defined the arithmetic excess return as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the ini- tial value of the portfolio. That work defined the geometric excess return, , as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the final value of the notional fund. In other words, the geo- metric excess return measures the added value in terms of a percentage of the value of the notional fund assets at the end of the period, not the start, which  is surely the main concern of any asset owner.  Bacon (2002) suggested that geometric excess returns are preferable because they are compoundable (geometric excess returns compound over multiple periods without residuals), they are convertible among currencies, and they are proportionate. The preferred definition of excess return should determine the choice of attribution methodology. Bain (1996), Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998), and Bacon (2002) each presented a geometric attribution model. Although developed independently and presented in dif- ferent ways, the models are, in fact, identical, which is an indication of the robustness of the approach. Geometric models built on the idea of successive notional portfolios can be found in Holbrook (1977), Hymans and Mulligan  (1980), and Allen (1991). As shown in Figure 6, each successive portfolio  Figure 6.

Step I represents the strategic, policy, or benchmark return. The difference between Step II and Step I represents the value added by active asset alloca- tion, and the difference between Step III and Step II represents the value added by security selection. More steps can be introduced for more complex,  multistep investment decision processes.  In the geometric attribution model, the difference between each step is  calculated geometrically:  (19)  Because geometric excess returns compound through time and because geometric allocation effects and geometric selection effects compound together within each period, geometric allocation and geometric selection must also compound through time. Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and  Bacon (2002) provided formulas for individual attribution effects as follows:  n Allocation. The contribution to geometric excess return from asset allocation in the ith sector  is  (20)  n Selection. The contribution to geometric excess return from stock  selection in sector i  is  (21)  or  or  (22)  In geometric attribution, interaction is typically included in the selection effect, although a geometric interaction effect can be derived if desired (see  Weber 2018).  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  19  Performance Attribution  Burnie et al. (1998) described perhaps the most well-known geometric methodology. Interestingly, they made the case for geometric attribution in a single-period context, not necessarily a multiperiod one. They also drew a distinction between top-down and bottom-up investment decision processes. A bottom-up investment decision process, they noted, assumes that security  selection takes precedence over asset allocation or is performed first.  Weber (2018) would consider the Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and Bacon (2002) models to be semi-geometric models. The reason is that although total selection and allocation effects compound to the geometric excess return, the effects within selection and allocation are still arithmeti- cally calculated. Menchero (2001/2002) offered a fully geometric model in  which individual selection and allocation effects compound through time.  Multicurrency Attribution  In this section, we consider three works specifically directed to performance  attribution in currency management.  Allen (1991). In an article entitled “Performance Attribution for Global Equity Portfolios,” Allen took the Holbrook (1977) concept of successive intermediate portfolios and applied it in a multicurrency environment. Allen stated that the trick to quantifying the impact of each type of active manage- ment decision involved calculating the return on a theoretical portfolio where one type of decision had been neutralised. Comparison of the return on the manager’s portfolio (where no decisions had been neutralised) with the return on the portfolio where a class of management decisions had been neutralised  allowed the impact of those neutralised decisions to be measured.  When carried out correctly, this process is quite neat. No unexplained residuals remain. Allen’s article provides a framework for quantifying the marginal impact that both policy decisions and active management decisions have on the performance of a global equity portfolio. At the heart of this framework is the assumption that the total return on an actively managed  global equity portfolio is explained by seven types of decisions:  1. the choice, at the policy level, of the unhedged dollar-denominated index  against which the active equity manager is to be measured  2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country  2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country  3. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based  on the manager’s expectation of the country’s equity returns  4. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based  on the manager’s expectation of the country’s currency returns  20  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  5. the timing of purchases and sales of securities (which implicitly affect the currency appreciation of the portfolio)  6. the choice, at the policy level, of the benchmark percentage of the portfo-  lio that is to be hedged passively against currency fluctuation  7. active decisions in the currency forward markets that cause the portfolio’s  return to deviate from that of the passively hedged benchmark  Allen’s article is noteworthy in that despite being based in the United States where arithmetic attribution prevails, he favored a geometric approach because the attribution factors are computed on a multiplicative basis, so they can be “chain-linked” across any time period to generate a cumulative factor. This method allows for evaluation of the long-term contribution of a selected  investment strategy to total return.  Ankrim and Hensel (1992, 1994). In 1992, Ankrim and Hensel pub- lished a Russell Research Commentary setting out a framework for multicur- rency performance attribution. This article, building on work by Brinson and Fachler (1985), separated out the impact of currency decisions—in particular, it recognised the significance of differential interest rates in currency decision  making. Ankrim and Hensel proposed  a method of performance attribution that retains the simplicity and intui- tive appeal of the Brinson and Fachler approach but breaks the returns from currency into two components: one that recognizes the opportunity cost of returns achievable in forward-currency markets and a second that measures the return attributable to the currency being less than fully hedged, both in the portfolio and in the benchmark with which the portfolio is com-  pared. (p. 2)  In the 1992 paper, Ankrim and Hensel identified three reasons that  including currency exposure in performance attribution causes problems:  First, and most obvious, it alters the returns ultimately received by the cli- ent. In Brinson and Fachler [1985], all returns are denominated in the home currency, but this convention makes it impossible to separate the contribu- tion to returns made by the manager’s country and security selection deci- sions from the impact of currency translation gains and losses.  Second, in practice, many portfolios have some portion (but not necessarily all) of their currency exposure hedged away. This requires an approach to performance attribution that allows the proportion of currency exposure  hedged to be variable.  Third, even if a portfolio is completely hedged, the client may choose to  adopt a benchmark that is less than fully hedged. (p. 2)  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  21  Performance Attribution  The authors defined two components of currency return: currency surprise and the forward premium. Currency surprise is uncertain, but the forward premium element is not because it depends on interest rate differentials at the  time of purchase:  Any approach to multicurrency attribution that lumps the forward premium and currency surprise together will credit positive performance to manag- ers who have large exposures in countries with positive forward premiums. Such an approach would penalize managers who hold large positions in  countries with negative forward premiums. (p. 12)  Karnosky and Singer (1994). Arguably the single most important paper published on attribution in the 1990s is Karnosky and Singer. This paper not only demonstrates that managing multicurrency portfolios is sub-optimal if currency is not managed independently but also provides a framework for calculating attribution effects, while critically, taking into account interest rate differentials. Karnosky and Singer resolved the issue of market and currency compounding by using continuously compounded returns in their model, admittedly this is only referred to in the small print, and solved the forward premium concern by thinking in terms of a “return premium” above local interest rates. Karnosky and Singer explained that the term “return premium” is used, rather than the more familiar “risk premium,” to make a subtle distinction in the underlying cash return. “Risk premium” refers to the return of a risky asset in excess of the return of a riskless asset, but in the authors’ analysis, the premiums depend on forward contracts with long maturities, where risk is probably not the dominant factor; hence, the  term “return premium” is used.  Karnosky and Singer’s framework demonstrates that separate currency and market strategies can be implemented within a global portfolio in which a specific currency weight is different from the weight of the associated country market. In effect, the authors applied the standard Brinson methodology twice—once to global portfolios by using local-return premiums (rather than simply local returns) to measure allocation and selection effects and, separately, to cash returns in the base currency of the asset owner in order to  calculate independent currency effects, as shown in Figure 7.  22  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Types of Attribution  Three types of attribution have been identified, and they are characterized by  the information used to calculate attribution effects, as follows:  1. Holdings-based attribution.  1. Holdings-based attribution.  Holdings-based or position-based attribution is calculated by analysing the underlying beginning-period holdings of the portfolio only. Typically, holdings-based attribution is calculated from monthly, weekly, or daily  data, with the shorter time periods leading to greater accuracy.  2. Transaction-based attribution.  2. Transaction-based attribution.  Transaction-based attribution is calculated by using both the holdings of the portfolio and the transactions (purchases and sales) that occurred  during the evaluation period.  Returns-based attribution.  3. Returns-based attribution.  Returns-based (or factor) attribution uses the historical returns of the total portfolio and/or individual securities to decompose the total return into multiple factors. The multifactor model is a regression equation that describes the way a particular security or portfolio reacts to industry sec-  tor, fundamental, macroeconomic, and other market factors.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  23  Performance Attribution  Asset-Grouping Attribution. The type of attribution favoured by the asset manager or asset owner will vary according to the investment decision process, investment objective, quality and availability of data, cost and time considerations, complexity, and reporting objective. Holdings-based and transaction-based attributions are mutually exclusive, and the choice is based on (for holdings based) cost, quality of data, ease of use, and rapid implemen- tation against (for transaction based) the advantages of reconciliation to the client-reported return, completeness, and accuracy. A number of authors— Giguere (2003), Bonafede and McCarthy (2003), Spaulding (2003a), Menchero and Hu (2003), and Bacon (2008)—argued for one approach or another. Spaulding, without an eye to existing software (and thus genuinely independently), concluded that the question “which is better?” does not have a simple answer. Too many variables are at work; in the end, the choice comes down to user preference. In later research, Spaulding (2018) showed that the residual implicit in holdings-based attribution can be extensive and is not nec- essarily correlated with turnover. Both holdings-based and transaction-based attribution are also described as “asset-grouping” or “variance type” attribu- tion, reflecting their requirements for asset allocation data and variance from benchmark data.  Attribution Based on Returns. Returns-based attribution, in contrast to the asset-grouping approach, might complement either holdings- or trans- action-based attribution in that it might reveal unexpected biases and make communication easier for asset managers using a factor-focused investment decision process. Returns-based attribution is a direct descendant of Fama (1972) decomposition, which is a single-factor model, via Sharpe (1988) and Fama and French (1993)—both three-factor models that include a general market factor together with a size and value factor—and Carhart (1997), a  four-factor model that introduced a momentum factor.  Amenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:  Amenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:  1. Implicit factor model. In this model, some factor analysis (e.g., a principal components analysis) is performed to statistically extract the factors from  the return’s time series. These factors may not be easily interpretable.  2. Explicit macro factor model. In this approach, macroeconomic variables  are used as factors.  3. Explicit micro factor model. In this approach, microeconomic attributes  are used as factors.  4. Explicit index factor model. In this approach, stock market indexes  (including style subindexes of the market) are used as factors.  24  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Within this framework, Amenc and Le Sourd (2003) described a wide  range of multifactor models in detail.  William F. Sharpe, who is associated with style attribution starting with his 1988 paper (see Sharpe 1988, 1992), used a 12-factor model to determine the passive return of a portfolio with the same style as the active asset man- ager. The difference between the actual portfolio return and the passive return with the same style would be a result of the manager’s selection ability. This type of style analysis provides a natural method for constructing appropriate style benchmarks. Sharpe (1988) stated that the usefulness of the asset-class model depends on the asset classes chosen for implementation. It is desirable that asset classes  e be mutually exclusive,  be mutually exclusive,  e be exhaustive, and  be exhaustive, and  e have returns that differ.  have returns that differ.  Each asset class should be proxied by a market capitalization–weighted index of the securities in it, and no security should be included in more than one asset class. Also, the asset classes should have low correlations with each other (or different standard deviations if correlations are high, as is the case in',\n",
       " 'many fixed-income styles or asset subclasses).  Surz (1999/2000) suggested a holdings-based or transaction-based form of style attribution based on the exclusive style characteristics of the hold- ings in the portfolio and benchmark. Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2005) proposed a regression-based attribution system linked to the parameters from the “Fundamental Law of Active Management” (Grinold and Kahn 1995, pp. 117–35). In a slight oversimplification, the fundamental law says that alpha is a function of manager skill as well as breadth (the number of inde- pendent bets made by the manager). The investigation by Clarke et al. (2005) indicated that the “law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression- based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise  related to constraints in constructing the portfolio” (p. 81).  Returns-based or regression-based attribution has the following  characteristics:  e It does not necessarily require the composition of the portfolio.

Risk-Adjusted Attribution  Campisi (2000) listed the characteristics of a good performance attribution  system as follows:  • It is consistent with the investment process and the manager’s decision-  making process.  • It uses a benchmark that reflects the manager’s strategic (long-term) asset  allocation.  e It measures the effect of the manager’s tactical (short-term) allocation shifts.  It measures the effect of the manager’s tactical (short-term) allocation shifts.  e It adjusts attribution of return for systematic risk(s).  It adjusts attribution of return for systematic risk(s).  Campisi (2000) suggested that many attribution systems fail at least one of these criteria and some fail all of them. Often, this failure occurs because returns are not adjusted for systematic risk and style (high vs. low beta, large vs. small size, value vs. growth orientation, etc.). Simply applying the alloca- tion/selection model often results in attribution results that are not neces- sarily meaningful because they do not reflect the investment process or the risks that drove return over the evaluation period. Risk-adjusted attribution is the real Cinderella of attribution analysis: In practice, risk-adjusted attri- bution is rarely performed. Ankrim (1992) proposed a form of risk-adjusted attribution using beta, as did Bacon (2008) and Obeid (2005). Kophamel (2003), thinking in terms of the volume of “performance cubes” rather than the familiar “performance areas” of the Brinson model, proposed attribution analysis in three dimensions. Spaulding (2016) suggested adjusting for total risk rather than systematic risk—in effect, attributing M2 returns (described in Modigliani 1997).2 Rather satisfactorily, Fisher and D’Alessandro (2019)  2Modigliani risk-adjusted performance (also known as M2, M2, the Modigliani–Modigliani measure, or RAP) is a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of some investment portfolio. It measures the returns of the portfolio adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of  some benchmark (e.g., the market).  26  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  took attribution full circle and tied risk-adjusted attribution back to the origi-  nal Fama decomposition.  Van Breukelen (2000) suggested a form of risk-adjusted attribution for fixed-income portfolios that takes into account the weighted duration “bets” of portfolio managers. Van Breukelen described a top-down investment deci- sion process in which overall duration is the first decision followed by a mar- ket allocation decision—a combination of country weight and duration—and finally, an issue selection decision within country. Currency effects are mea- sured separately using a Karnosky and Singer (1994) type of approach. The value added by each step of the decision process is measured by using a series  of reference or successive notional portfolios.  Fixed-Income Attribution  The simple Brinson model is widely regarded as being insufficient for all but the simplest of fixed-income investment strategies. McLaren (2002) explained that classical attribution models (e.g., Brinson’s model) are inap- propriate for fixed-income portfolio analysis because the allocation decision in equity models does not explicitly account for yield-curve positioning (dura- tion) set by fixed-income managers. This omission is significant because the duration decision, which has no direct equity counterpart, plays an impor- tant role in the fixed-income decision-making process. Campisi (2000) also explained why fixed income needs its own attribution model and pointed out  five critical differences between stocks and bonds:  1. Bonds are temporary lending agreements with a stated maturity, whereas  stocks are permanent investments.  2. Bonds promise a fixed return, with a strictly defined upside if held to maturity; stocks promise uncertain returns and the unlimited upside (and  downside) associated with ownership.  3. Bonds are typically purchased by institutions, which often hold them until maturity. This pattern results in a limited secondary market for bonds. Stock investing takes place in an active secondary market. As a  result, bonds are illiquid compared with stocks.  4. Bond performance is driven by promised income and by changes in market yields: When market yields rise above a bond’s stated yield, the price of that bond falls. As a result, the relevant risk for bonds is sensitivity to changes in yields. Stock performance is driven by the market’s economic sectors, and the principal risks for stocks are (a) sensitivity to the overall market, or beta,  and (b) the individual fortunes of the company invested in.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  27  Performance Attribution  5. Bonds are simply the promise of a stream of cash flows; thus, they are relatively homogeneous in their pricing. For example, bonds with the same maturity and default risk will generally sell at the same price. Therefore, bonds reflect little selection effect. Stock prices, in contrast, respond dramatically to company-specific conditions and thus reflect a large selection effect.  Distinct approaches for fixed-income attribution emerged quite quickly in the early development of attribution. The method described in Wagner and Tito (1977) is derived directly from Fama decomposition, with beta replaced by a systematic risk measure for bonds—namely, duration. In this approach, fixed-income portfolio performance is driven by promised income and by the  effect that changes in yields have on bond prices.  No single, standardised way of defining fixed-income attribution exists. The asset class has more securities than in equity investing, more types of instruments, more variety in investment process, and more quantitative mod- elling requirements. It also has various ways of describing change in the yield curve and a broad array of investment mandates. Murira and Sierra (2006) explained that each of the commercially available systems uses its own partic- ular brand of return attribution. In fact, because of differences in the defini- tion and computation of the factors, different systems often provide different  values for the same return factor.  Other authors have made various contributions to developments in fixed-income attribution—developments often linked to specific invest- ment decision processes or specific software capabilities. These authors include Ramaswamy (2001), Giguere (2005), Colin (2005, 2014), Gillet and Hommolie (2006), Colin, Cubilie, and Bardoux (2006), Silva, de Carvalho,  and Ornelas (2010), Simmons and Karadakov (2013/2014), and Dias (2017).  Figure 8 illustrates the attribution effects in a typical fixed-income attri- bution model. Here, carry represents the return resulting from the passage of time: coupon payments, accrued interest, and rolling down the yield curve (the  pull-to-par effect as the instrument approaches maturity).  In Figure 8, the yield-curve factor represents the changing shape of the yield curve, parallel shift (the impact of a parallel move of the yield curve), twist (a change in slope of the yield curve), and curvature (change in the curvature of the yield curve). Often, twist and curvature are combined and  described as nonparallel changes in the yield curve or curve reshape.  Spread is the return that comes from the widening or narrowing of credit spreads.  28  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Figure 8.

Source: Redrawn from a diagram in Dai and Elliot (2014/2015).  Selection effects include convexity, any optionality in the payment of future coupons (important with mortgage-backed securities because mortgages can be prepaid), and a residual. Normally quite small, residuals are classified by Dias (2017) as caused by the model or caused by data errors and systematic or  random effects.  In the other category, the price effect captures the difference in price sources between the bonds in the portfolio and bonds in the benchmark. This is a nonmanagement effect that is a particular problem for fixed income. The trading effect measures the impact of intraday trading. Currency captures the impact of independent currency management, typically by using a Karnosky  and Singer (1994) type of approach.  Fixed-income attribution models can be characterised as either top-down successive portfolio methods (e.g., Van Breukelen 2000) or bottom-up (yield- curve decomposition) methods. Bottom-up methods calculate the impact of yield-curve movements and credit spreads on individual bonds in both the portfolio and the benchmark and aggregate results. Top-down models are perhaps easier to implement and more effective in terms of communicating to  asset owners and other stakeholders.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  29  Performance Attribution  Gillet and Hommolie (2006) described the bottom-up approach as a suc- cessive spread methodology that can be split into two phases. The first phase consists of decomposing the bond prices into its various characteristics (pas- sage of time, evolution of yield curves, variation of spreads). This decomposi- tion is applied simultaneously to the constituents of the portfolio and to the constituents of the benchmark. The second phase consists only of regrouping the separated elements according to the investment decision process (p. 65). Bottom-up models are more difficult and expensive to implement but more  appropriate to the detailed investment decision processes of the front office.  McLaren (2002) offered a geometric fixed-income attribution model, which is not common. Most fixed-income attribution models are arithme- tic in nature, although for the most part, they can be adapted for geometric analysis. The reason may be that excess returns are typically smaller than in equity investing and the underlying benchmark returns less volatile, mak- ing the difference between geometric and arithmetic excess return smaller in magnitude.  Other Attribution Issues  Other issues in attribution pertain to derivatives, transaction costs, frequency  of the analysis, and application to money-weighted returns.  Derivatives. The Brinson model is an incredibly robust methodology. Stannard (1997), Menchero (2002/2003), Bacon (2008), Fischer and Wermers (2013), and Bacon, Thompson, and van der Westhuizen (2018)—all described, using appropriate notional assets and notional returns, how the standard Brinson model can be adapted to handle derivative instruments, including  index futures, options (of various types), and swaps and short positions.  Transaction Costs. Laker (2001) pointed out that transaction costs— explicit costs (such as brokerage and taxes) and implicit costs (such as the bid–offer spread, market impact, and opportunity cost)—are not dealt with explicitly in most performance attribution methods but are normally included within the stock selection effect. In a bottom-up, security-level attribution approach, Laker suggested using the standard Brinson selection formulas at the security level to calculate the impact of transaction costs (explicit and implicit) and intraday timing effects. He suggested that any return difference between an individual security’s daily return and its return in the index must  be the result of transaction costs and timing within the day.  Frequency of Analysis. DiBartolomeo (2003) challenged the assump-  tion that aggregated daily attribution analysis is more appropriate than  30  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  monthly aggregated analysis and suggested that applying typical attribution methods to daily data draws on assumptions that are highly biased and unre- liable. Beyond simply observing the attributed returns, he believed, you must be able to judge their statistical significance. He suggested that recommend-  ing daily observation rests on four fallacies:  1. Daily performance is economically meaningful. Not necessarily—for example, information is lost by adjusting for the timing of cash flows in time-weighted returns.  2. Daily returns are themselves accurate. Not necessarily—many securities are traded on multiple exchanges or electronic markets at different times, so exactly which closing price is used to compute the daily returns can have a sizable impact. Also, coordinating the timing of corporate actions  such as dividends, spin-offs, and mergers with index providers is difficult.  3. Observations are assumed to be independent. Investment portfolios do not start as a fresh set of management decisions every trading day. Thus the rationale of an independent “start fresh” assumption is weak. Substantial path dependencies are present in portfolio management in practice, which reduces any justification for the assumption of indepen-  dent periodic observations of manager skill.  4. Parametric distributional assumptions are accurate. Most of the aca- demic literature illustrates that the imperfections of our assumptions with respect to quarterly or monthly return data are small, whereas for daily data, we must consistently reject the correctness of the assumptions. In general, daily security returns have fat-tailed distributions, with large return events occurring far more often than would be consistent with a normal distribution. This issue is less of a problem with quarterly or  monthly returns.  DiBartolomeo (2003) concluded that daily performance attribution com- pounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return than attribu- tion using less frequent data—but at a tremendous cost in our ability to judge the statistical significance of the results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in our estimates of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors (believing an estimate is  statistically significant when it is not).  Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003) certainly questioned the ben- efits of more frequent and more detailed performance measurement. They suggested that the cost of daily stock-level attribution is difficult to justify  (although given recent developments in technology their views may have  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

They suggested that monthly modified Dietz calculations might actually be near the optimum balance and that a simple alternative might be  running actual profit and loss for each position.3  Frongello (2006), in contrast, made the case for daily attribution analysis. He explained that in the real world, risk factor mismatches may occur unin- tentionally—caused by neglect, accidents, or simply changes in the risk pro- file of securities. Performance attribution should seek to explain performance resulting from all risk factor mismatches. Daily attribution is the best method  for monitoring the status and consequence of risk factor mismatches (p. 367).  Zangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) suggested that daily attribution, if done methodically, should produce results that are superior to monthly attri- bution. They pointed out that regardless of the methodology used, what is ultimately critical is the process governing attribution. The five core compo- nents of what they considered to be a good return attribution process are as  follows:  1. Data management and quality control. This task is the most important.

The way in which information is presented is important, so  timely, accurate, and easy-to-understand attribution reports are necessary.  Zangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) concluded that process plays a criti- cal part in determining the accuracy of attribution results. Return attribution should be based on a process that monitors key input data and evaluates attri-  bution results on a daily basis.  Attribution of Money-Weighted Return. For purposes of comparative analysis, most attribution analysis is naturally undertaken on time-weighted rates of return (TWR). Attribution analysis of money-weighted rates of return (MWR) is less common. Yet, attribution analysis of MWR is still  undertaken in the form of the modified Dietz return calculation method.  3The modified Dietz method is a mathematical technique to evaluate a portfolio’s return based on a weighted calculation of its cash flow. The method takes into account the timing of  cash flows and assumes a constant rate of return over a specified period of time.  32',\n",

Performance Attribution  It was, in fact, recommended by Menchero and Hu (2003) in the context of transaction-based attribution and by Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003). O’Shea and Jeet (2018) suggested single-period attribution of modified Dietz returns for private equity. Spaulding and Campisi (2007) made the case for money-weighted attribution. They suggested that because cash flow move- ments are a factor that defines the investment process, these cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation system instead of  being neutralised (as occurs in the time-weighted calculation).  The modified Dietz method is a first-order approximation of the internal rate of return (IRR) and, according to Bacon (2007a), an intermediate step in the evolution from calculating IRR (which some might describe as a true MWR) to the true TWR. The IRR is a standard return measure for illiquid asset classes—such as private equity, real estate, and infrastructure—and is common at the total-asset owner level, where comparative analysis is less rel- evant. The modified Dietz method is easy to disaggregate and more straight- forward to attribute than the IRR. Nevertheless, Illmer and Marty (2003) and Illmer (2009) offered a solution to the attribution of the true MWR in terms of both return and profit and loss.  D’Alessandro (2016) suggested analysts should end the debate about which method of return to use, TWR or MWR, and require the presentation  of both with an attribution between the two.  Conclusion: The Evolution of Attribution Methodologies  The evolution of attribution analysis is clear, easy to trace, and illustrated in Figure 9, which maps, not necessarily in chronological order, the major  developments in attribution analysis discussed in this review.  Comparative performance measurement starts with the BAI (1968) study, but attribution analysis itself starts with Fama (1972). From that point, a divergence occurs between asset-grouping and variance-type attribution, with the UK SIA (1972) introducing the concept of selection, allocation, and notional portfolios and return-based attribution developed a little later by Sharpe (1992), Fama and French (1993), Carhart (1997), and many others. Fixed-income attribution naturally veers in a different direction via Wagner and Tito (1977), who replaced beta with duration in the Fama decomposition, and Lord (1997), who responded to the investment decision processes of bond  managers, which are so different from those of equity managers.  Very early, a split occurred between, on the one hand, the dominant arithmetic Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson et al. model (1986) and, on the other hand, the total level geometric approach of Holbrook (1977).

Algorithms started to be published several years after their initial use in Carino (1999), soon followed by GRAP (1997), Menchero (2000), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002). Allen (1991) is a direct link from Holbrook but addressed multicurrency issues. Burnie et al. (1998), together with Bain (1996) and Bacon (2002), developed geometric selection and allocation calcu-  lations that were missing from Holbrook (1977) and from Allen. Ankrim and  34  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Hensel (1992) and, with more success, Karnosky and Singer (1994) adapted the basic Brinson model for multicurrency attribution, including, importantly, taking into account interest rate differentials. Van Breukelen (2000) adapted  the Brinson model for successive portfolio fixed-income attribution.  Figure 9 firmly cements Brinson and Fachler (1985) at the centre of developments in attribution analysis. In more recent years, we have seen many variants of yield-curve decomposition models, which reflects the diver- sity of fixed-income investment decision processes. Because of low uptake, risk-adjusted attribution is not illustrated here but could be represented by a  link between return-based methods and the Brinson model.  Bibliography  Allen, Gregory C. 1991. “Performance Attribution for Global Equity  Portfolios.” Journal of Portfolio Management 18 (1): 59–65.  This article provides a framework for quantifying the marginal impact that both policy decisions and active management decisions have on the per- formance of a global equity portfolio. The article is noteworthy because, influenced by currency effects, it represents an early US-based example of geometric or multiplicative attribution; it emphasises the value of “no  unexplained residuals” and attribution factors that “chain-link.”  Amenc, Noel, and Veronique Le Sourd. 2003.

This wide-ranging academic work evaluating the quality of the portfolio management process connects each of the major categories of techniques and practices to the unifying and seminal conceptual developments of modern portfolio theory. Of particular relevance to attribution analysis is Chapter 6 on multifactor models and their application to performance measurement, Chapter 7 on evaluating the investment management pro- cess and decomposing performance, and Chapter 8 on fixed-income secu-  rity investment.  Amenc, Noel, Daphne Sfeir, and Lionel Martellini. 2003. “An Integrated Framework for Style Analysis and Performance Measurement.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 7 (4): 35–41.  This article explains that risk-adjusted performance evaluation consists of using a factor model to compare the overall performance of a manager with the “normal” performance the manager would get from being exposed to  rewarded sources of risk. The article suggests the use of two important  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Ankrim, Ernest M. 1992. “Risk-Adjusted Performance Attribution.”  Financial Analysts Journal 48 (2): 75–82.  The author suggests that classical attribution analysis does not consider risk and posits that in general, such methods will tend to overreward risky managers and underreward conservative ones. The author proposes an  attribution approach that adjusts for the systematic risk of each sector.  Ankrim, Ernest M., and Chris R.

These articles, both originally published in a Russell Research Commentary, expand the work of Brinson and Fachler (1985), separate out the impact of currency decisions, and, in particular, recognise the signifi- cance of differential interest rates in currency decision making.  Bacon, Carl R. 2002. “Excess Returns—Arithmetic or Geometric?” Journal  of Performance Measurement 6 (3): 23–31.  This article sets out to define arithmetic and geometric excess returns. The author explains that the choice of an arithmetic or geometric attribution method is really a choice between using arithmetic or geometric excess return, and he expresses a preference for geometric excess returns based on compoundability, convertibility, and proportionality. Finally, the author presents a geometric attribution model that, although developed indepen-  dently, is actually identical to that of Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998).  Bacon, Carl R. 2007a. “Money-Weighted versus Time-Weighted Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 11 (Performance Attribution  Supplement): 21–27.  The author illustrates and explains the evolution of return calculations from internal rates of return to true time-weighted rates of return. In summary, the author suggests that time-weighted forms of attribution will remain  dominant because of the following:  • The time-weighted rate of return is most appropriate for comparisons  of managers.  36  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  • Internal rates of return assume a constant rate of return difficult to  attribute.  e Investment decisions are independent of the total amount invested.  Investment decisions are independent of the total amount invested.  • Time-weighted attribution can measure the manager’s timing  decisions.  • Money-weighted attribution misallocates estimates of manager skill  between stock selection and asset allocation.  Bacon, Carl R. 2007b. “Multi-Currency Attribution—Part 1: The Real  Nature of Multi-Currency.” Journal of Performance Measurement 12 (1): 22–29.  The author lists the issues of genuinely multicurrency investment decision  processes:  © compounding effects of market and currency returns  compounding effects of market and currency returns  e interest rate differentials interest rate differentials  e unrealized gains/losses in forward currency contracts  unrealized gains/losses in forward currency contracts  • securities denominated in currencies other than the currency of eco-  nomic exposure  Building on the work of Allen (1991), the author moves on to describe a naive form of currency attribution (naive in that it ignores currency  differentials).  Bacon, Carl R. 2007/2008. “Multi-Currency Attribution—Part 2: Factoring  in Interest Rate Differentials.” Journal of Performance Measurement 12 (2): 8–19.

Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the  Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison. Bank Administration Institute.  The purpose of the BAI study, the starting point for performance analysis, was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds in order to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The report recommended, among other things, the use of market value, not book  value; total return; time-weighted rates of return; and taking risk into account.  Bain, William G. 1996. Investment Performance Measurement. Woodhead Publishing.  This book is, for the most part, concerned with the measurement and anal- ysis of pension fund investment portfolios. Most notable is its description of the WM Company’s multiplicative (or geometric) attribution methodol-  ogy (pp. 65–74).  Banchik, Sean. 2004/2005. “Pure and Inter-Period Interaction Effects in  Multi-Period Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 9 (2): 53–63.  The author concludes that there is no single correct way to link single- period arithmetic effects to produce multiperiod effects. The appropriate methodology is generally one of personal preference. The most relevant question for the reader is not which method is correct but whether the reader  understands where these effects are included in the chosen methodology.  Bonafede, Julia K., Steven J. Foresti, and Peter Matheos. 2002. “A Multi- Period Linking Algorithm That Has Stood the Test of Time.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 7 (1): 15–26.  The authors introduce a linking algorithm for multiperiod arithmetic attri- bution. The method was in use from the early 1980s, but this description  was not published until 2002.

Only buy-and-hold returns are consistent with benchmarking needs; therefore, performance attribution for portfolio management should use holdings-based return analysis. The authors propose an additional term called “trading” to explain the  difference.  Brinson, Gary P., and Nimrod Fachler. 1985. “Measuring Non-US Equity  Portfolio Performance.” Journal of Portfolio Management 11 (3): 73–76.  This hugely important paper documented, for the first time, selection and allocation formulas at the sector level. The paper helped lend “Brinson” to the name of the most commonly used attribution model.  Brinson, Gary P., L. Randolph Hood, Jr., and Gilbert L. Beebower. 1986. “Determinants of Portfolio Performance.” Financial Analysts Journal 42 (4):  39–44.  This extremely well-known paper is important for two reasons. First, it provided the general framework for the decomposition of portfolio return into selection, allocation, and interaction effects (although this last piece is described as “other” in the paper). Second, and more controversially, the paper made the observation that policy decisions make by far the biggest  contribution to the differences in returns among pension funds.  Brinson, Gary P., Brian D. Singer, and Gilbert L. Beebower. 1991. “Determinants of Portfolio Performance II: An Update.” Financial Analysts  Journal 47 (3): 40–48.

Most attribution models are arithmetically formulated and measure the manager’s “value added”—or the difference between a fund’s return and a passive benchmark return. The authors of this paper contended that such models are prone to error and may produce inconclusive results. This paper illustrates the benefits of using geometric attribution, which defines the “management effect” as the ratio of the fund return factor to the bench-  mark return factor.  This paper is of fundamental importance in addressing the relative advan-  tage of geometric over arithmetic attribution, multiperiod attribution, and  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Campisi, Stephen. 2000. “Primer on Fixed Income Performance Attribution.”  Journal of Performance Measurement 4 (4): 14–25.  The author explains that the drivers of fixed-income performance are fun- damentally different from those of equity portfolios. Bond portfolio per- formance is driven by promised income and by the effect that changes in yields have on bond prices. The author proposes a simple attribution model that provides a straightforward method for identifying the systematic risk and stylistic factors of the asset manager’s strategy.  Campisi, Stephen. 2004a. “The Case for Money-Weighted Performance  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (3): 31–41.  The proposal in this paper is that although the case is irrefutable for accept- ing the time-weighted return as the preferred method for measuring the return of an asset manager, an equally compelling case can be made for accepting the money-weighted return as the appropriate method for evalu- ating the source of that active return; that is, the money-weighted return is  the correct method for performance attribution.  Campisi, Stephen. 2004b. “Debunking the Interaction Myth.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 8 (4): 63–70.  The author refutes the idea of “interaction” and demonstrates that interac- tion arises from either a poor attribution model or a poor implementation of a sound attribution model. When a sound attribution model is imple- mented correctly, the interaction effect is eliminated. Despite the appearance of mathematical rigor in the calculation of interaction, investors and clients  understand that interaction is not a legitimate part of the investment process.

This paper discloses Frank Russell Company’s method of combining attribution effects over time and displaying results in an additive man- ner. The paper is important in that it is the first time a software firm pub- lished its method for linking multiple-period attribution results without residuals, thus encouraging other firms to publish their in-house linking  methodologies.

The author offers a derivation of the dollar family of linking algorithms (see Frongello 2002a, 2002b; GRAP 1997; and Bonafede, Foresti, and Matheos 2002) and discusses further refinements whilst cautioning the  performance analyst to balance complexity against practicality.  Clarke, Roger, Harindra de Silva, and Steven Thorley. 2005. “Performance  Attribution and the Fundamental Law.” Financial Analysts Journal 61 (5): 70–83.  The authors propose a regression-based attribution system linked to the parameters from the “Fundamental Law of Active Management” (Grinold and Kahn 1995). Their investigation indicates that the law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression-based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise related to constraints in  constructing the portfolio.

The objective of performance analysis should be to measure the various elements of performance that reflect the decisions involved in the investment process. The author then suggests that investment decisions may be classified in two ways: selection and allocation. This paper is one of  the first to use the term “allocation.”  Colin, Andrew M. 2005.

Colin, Andrew M., Mathieu Cubilie, and Frederic Bardoux. 2006. “A New Approach to the Decomposition of Yield Curve Movements for Fixed Income  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 10 (4): 18–28.  The authors discuss the most common ways to describe yield-curve movements: shift, twist, and curvature. Shift is a parallel movement of the curve across all maturities. Twist is a steepening or flattening of the curve, and curvature occurs when a curve becomes more or less humped. The authors suggest an approach to decomposing curve changes that cir- cumvents the difficulties inherent in principal components analysis and  model fitting.  Dai, Tianci, and Mark Elliot. 2014/2015. “Fixed Income Attribution with  Carry Effect.” Journal of Performance Measurement 19 (2): 7–18.  These authors propose a way to capture the true carry return. Typical fixed- income return decompositions attempt to include the carry return, but the return is usually (inadequately) approximated by yield. The authors argue that using an accurate calculation better isolates the effects of yield-curve  shifts, shape, and position; spread changes; and other factors.  42  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Darling, Robert, and Alastair MacDougall. 2002/2003. “Using Performance Statistics: Have Measurers Lost the Plot?” Journal of Performance Measurement  7 (2): 22–32.  The authors question the benefits of carrying out performance measure- ment that is more frequent than monthly or in more detail. They suggest that the cost of daily stock-level attribution is difficult to justify and argue that monthly modified Dietz calculations may actually be near the optimal balance. A simple alternative, they note, might be to run actual profit-and- loss data for each position.

Davies, Owen, and Damien Laker. 2001. “Multiple-Period Performance Attribution Using the Brinson Model.” Journal of Performance Measurement  6 (1): 12–22.  The authors agree that multiperiod arithmetic attribution is difficult but suggest an exact method for calculating attributes over multiple periods in the Brinson model at the portfolio, not the sector, level. They further sug- gest that because of the exact nature of their model, evaluating the accu-  racy of other proposed methods would be helpful.  Davis, Ben, and Jose Menchero. 2010/2011. “Beyond Brinson: Establishing the Link between Sector and Factor Models.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 15 (2): 8–20.  The authors show that the classic Brinson model is a special kind of factor (return-based) attribution model.

This paper presents four fallacies about daily observation and concludes that daily performance attribution compounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return but at a tremendous cost in the analyst’s ability to judge the statistical significance of results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in estimates  of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors.  Dietz, Peter O. 1966.

This truly seminal paper was the first to suggest decomposing the returns of a portfolio in the manner the author proposes. Fama suggests finer breakdowns of performance than given by the Sharpe, Treynor, or Jensen. For example, methods are presented for distinguishing, on the one hand, the part of an observed return that results from ability to pick the best securities of a given level of risk (“selectivity”) from, on the other hand, the part that is a result of predictions of general market price movements (“timing”). The author also suggests methods for measuring the effects of forgone diversification when an investment manager decides to concentrate  the portfolio’s holdings in what the manager thinks are a few “winners.”  44  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

In the context of fixed income, this  group agreed to the following:  • Excess return is generally low; therefore, methodologies must be accu-  rate with small residuals.  The attribution results must match the investment decision process.  • The price differential between the portfolio and the benchmark is not  an effect attributable to the manager.  • The calculation frequency should be as high as possible to avoid distortion.  The group described two types of attribution:  1. Yield-curve decomposition, which breaks down performance into passage of time, yield-curve movements (however described), and spread  variations. This analysis is mostly intended for portfolio managers.  46  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  2. Exposure decomposition, a top-down approach based on intermediate reference portfolios. It can be better understood by noninvestment professionals than yield-curve decomposition and is useful when  explaining the source of added value.  Gillet, Philippe, and Bernard Hommolie. 2006. “Fixed Income Attribution: A Combined Methodology.” Journal of Performance Measurement 10 (4): 64–78.  The authors describe two existing forms of fixed-income performance attribution—“successive portfolios” and “successive spreads”—and suggest  a combined model.

Building on the work of Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), the authors suggest that if US T-bills are the appropriate naive alternative for US investors, then asset allocation away from T-bills is, as commonly thought, the single decision with the greatest impact on an investor’s return. But if a diversified mix is the alternative, then the impact of departing from this alternative may be no greater than the impact of other decisions, including  security selection.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

       " 'This important paper pulls together the work of the BAI (1968), Fama (1972), and the Society of Investment Analysts (SIA 1972). The article establishes the importance of investment objectives, the nature of liabilities, the need for investment policies, and the responsibilities of trustees. Crucially, the author decomposes the decision-making process into policy decisions, strategy deci- sions, and selection. Holbrook suggests the use of notional funds for each step of the decision process and establishes a geometric relationship for the  value added (or subtracted) at each step of the process.

The authors document, from a starting date of 1926, the monthly and annual returns on US stocks, bonds, T-bills, and what they call “inflation” (a hypothetical asset returning the rate of change in the US CPI). They calculate historical (achieved) risk premiums based on differences between the average  returns of these assets and make probabilistic projections of future returns.

Jiang, Yindeng, and Joseph Saenz. 2014/2015. “The Associative Property of  Attribution Linking.” Journal of Performance Measurement 19 (2): 19–24.  The authors suggest that the “associative” property is necessary for attri- bution linking. Among the popular smoothing/linking methods, they show that Carino (1999) and Frongello (2002a) are associative, whereas Menchero (2000) and various ad hoc methods are not. They also suggest  that Frongello and Carino produce similar results.  Karnosky, Denis S., and Brian D. Singer. 1994. Global Asset Management and Performance Attribution. Charlottesville, VA: Research Foundation of the  Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts.  The most important work written on performance attribution in the 1990s, this book develops an analytical framework for evaluating global asset markets and uses that framework to construct a performance attribution system that isolates the effects of market allocation, currency management,  and security selection on global portfolios.  This book is important for demonstrating that a multinational portfolio is suboptimally managed if currency is not managed independently and for demonstrating the importance of interest rate differentials between  currencies.  Kingston, T.D. 1973. “Measuring Investment Performance [with discussion].” In Transactions of the Faculty of Actuaries 34: 241–98. Cambridge University  Press.  This work is another early paper on the whole subject of measuring invest- ment performance. Section 3 deals particularly with performance attri- bution. Methods are suggested for comparing actual rates of return with those of indexes, notional portfolios, and other funds. Of most interest is the formal record of the discussion after the paper’s presentation.

The authors propose a smoothing algorithm that consists of “separating  pure effects from changes in each factor and the remainder (cross-product)”.  Kirievsky, Leonid, and Anatoly Kirievsky. 2004. “Attribution Analysis: Old  and New.” Journal of Performance Measurement 9 (1): 60–74.  In this article, the authors describe in detail the problem of attribution analysis and provide a precise method of solving it. They analyse the short- comings of other multiperiod linking and smoothing algorithms and the geometric model and critique the original Brinson et al. (1986) paper. Based on an example of historical Australian funds data, they suggest that  security selection is the main determinant of return.  Kophamel, Andrew. 2003. “Risk-Adjusted Performance Attribution: A New Paradigm for Performance Analysis.” Journal of Performance Measurement  7 (4): 51–62.  This article proposes a three-dimensional approach to link risk and return via the intuitive construct of volume and the “performance cube” rather  than using the familiar two-dimensional areas of the Brinson model.  Laker, Damian. 2000. “What Is This Thing Called ‘Interaction’?” Journal of  Performance Measurement 5 (1): 43–57.  In this paper, the author suggests that the interaction term has a bad reputation. He states that portfolio managers do not distinguish between interaction and error terms but arbitrarily add them to other terms. As a  result, they find interaction difficult to explain to clients.  The author argues that the interaction term is sometimes more explanatory than the other attributes and that attempts to avoid confusion by “getting rid of ” the interaction term in a Brinson model are, in fact, likely to create  more confusion.  Laker, Damian. 2001. “Incorporating Transaction Cost Measurement into  Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (4): 13–24.  This paper points out that transaction costs (explicit costs, such as brokerage  and taxes, and implicit costs, such as the bid–offer spread, market impact,  50  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  and opportunity cost) are not dealt with explicitly in most performance attribution methods and are normally included in the stock selection effect. The author suggests a stock-level, bottom-up style of attribution approach that identifies and separates the impact of intraday timing and transaction costs.  Laker, Damian. 2002. “A View from Down-Under.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 6 (4): 5–13.  The author suggests an exact method for multiperiod arithmetic attribu- tion at a total level that can be used to evaluate the accuracy of various  linking and smoothing methods, including naive compounding.  Laker, Damian. 2003. “Perspectives on Transaction-Based Attribution.”  Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (1): 10–23.  The author defines transaction-based attribution, holdings-based attribu- tion, and transaction-based attribution that identifies transaction costs, and he provides worked examples of each. The paper explains that the simplicity, reduced number of calculations, and reduced data burden of  holdings-based attribution come at the cost of accuracy.  Laker, Damian. 2005. “Toward Consensus on Multiple-Period Arithmetic  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 9 (3): 26–37.  The author defends criticism of his “exact” method for calculating multipe-  riod attributes at the total-fund level.  Lord, Timothy J. 1997. “The Attribution of Portfolio and Index Returns in  Fixed Income.” Journal of Performance Measurement 2 (1): 45–57.  This paper focuses on performance attribution as it applies to fixed-income portfolios and indexes. More clearly described as bottom-up contribution analysis of the portfolio compared with its benchmark, this paper emphasizes the requirement for the attribution to be consistent with the investment strategy of the portfolio manager. Income and price returns are calculated separately. Price return is then attributed according to duration, yield-curve distribution, sector allocation, and issue selection. Shift and twist are considered components of duration return; and sector and specific issuer effects are considered components of spread return. Included also are a calendar return (the price return resulting solely from the passage of time) and a residual return (the difference between the actual return and  the model’s estimate of return).  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

McLaren, Andrew. 2002. “A Framework for Multiple Currency Fixed  Income Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 6 (4): 59–79.  This article presents a framework for analysing the investment decisions of a multicurrency fixed-income portfolio. The significant difference from the classical model is the addition of a reference yield-curve portfolio to  measure the return generated from interest rate exposure decisions.  Menchero, Jose G. 2000. “An Optimized Approach to Linking Attribution  Effects over Time.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (1): 36–42.  In this paper, the author presents an intuitive and robust algorithm for linking single-period attribution effects over time. The method consists of first deducing the correct scaling between the single-period excess returns and the linked excess return and then optimally distributing the residual  among the different time periods.  Menchero, Jose G. 2000/2001. “A Fully Geometric Approach to Performance  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 5 (2): 22–30.  In this paper, the author examines the close relationship between geo- metric and arithmetic calculations and their effects and uses the analogy to arrive at an intuitive mathematical form for attribution analysis. Also, while addressing the issues involved in aggregating the attribution effects  across sectors, the author shows how they can be linked across time.  Menchero, Jose G. 2002/2003. “Performance Attribution with Short  Positions.” Journal of Performance Measurement 7 (2): 39–50.  In this paper, the author shows how classical attribution analysis can be  adapted to include short positions.

Performance Attribution  Menchero, Jose G., and Ben Davis. 2009. “Multi-Currency Performance  Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 14 (1): 45–55.  The authors present a comprehensive model for attributing the performance of multicurrency portfolios based on the Karnosky and Singer (1994) framework but with certain refinements. In particular, they explicitly account for the cross-product effect derived from repatriating local profits  back to the base currency of the investor.  Menchero, Jose G., and Junmin Hu. 2003. “Errors in Transaction-Based  Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (1): 57–69.  The authors identify three types of transaction-based attribution: true time-weighted methods that use a buy-and-hold assumption and two types of transaction-based attribution based on modified Dietz return calcula- tions. The two latter types are as follows: Type 1, which accounts for exter- nal and internal cash flows, and Type 2, which accounts for internal cash flows only. The authors acknowledge that the holdings-based approach will lead to differences between the actual return and the computed return, but they suggest that the magnitude should be small and typically depend on volatility and portfolio turnover. They suggest that this difference should be attributed to trading effects. The authors show that both Type 1 and Type 2 approaches will lead to attribution errors, so they ultimately prefer  the holdings-based approach.

Murira, Bernard, and Hector Sierra. 2006/2007. “Fixed Income Attribution: A  Unified Framework—Part 2.” Journal of Performance Measurement 11 (2): 8–21.  A continuation of Part 1 (Murira and Sierra 2006/2007), this part dis- cusses some practical issues related to the attribution process—in particu- lar, the fact that duration is not a perfect measure. Other issues addressed are key-rate duration versus partial duration, selecting the appropriate point to use on the yield curve, dealing with transactions, linking multipe-  riod returns, and the accuracy of security prices.

Sharpe describes the returns as leaving “tracks in the sand” that can be interpreted, by using regression analysis, as  style exposures.  Sharpe, William F. 1992. “Asset Allocation: Management Style and  Performance Measurement.” Journal of Portfolio Management 18 (2): 7–19.  The author, building on Sharpe (1988), suggests a 12-asset-class model that determines the passive return of a notional portfolio having the same style as the asset manager. The manager’s selection return is the difference  between the actual return and the passive return in the same style.  SIA. 1972. The Measurement of Portfolio Performance for Pension Funds.  Society of Investment Analysts.  Toward the end of 1970, a working group was set up by the UK Society of Investment Analysts to make recommendations on the subject of portfolio performance measurement for pension funds. The resulting report spe- cifically puts forward methods of calculating portfolio performance, thus  making possible a general comparison of funds.',\n",
       " 'The approach recommended has two aims: (1) the calculation of a rate of return for comparing funds and (2) the decomposition of the performance of a fund into two components—selection of stocks and selection of sec- tors. This report is, therefore, really the starting point of performance attri- bution because it both defines stock selection and sector allocation (called  “sector selection” in the report) and provides a worked example.  Silva, Antonio F.A., Pablo J.C. de Carvalho, and Jose R.H.

Simmons, Peter, and Anton Karadakov. 2013/2014. “A Simplified Fixed Income Performance Attribution Model.” Journal of Performance Measurement  18 (2): 44–55.  The authors create an attribution model that follows a top-down approach but is built from the bottom up.

The author compares a number of smoothing and linking algorithms.  Spaulding, David. 2003a. “Holdings- vs. Transaction-Based Attribution: An  Overview.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (1): 52–56.  The author concludes that the question “which is better?” has no simple answer. Too many variables are at work. Some firms’ trading volumes are such that a simple buy-and-hold model will not provide even the remotest degree of precision. But how much more must a firm spend? And for many  firms, any incremental benefit can be justified by the added cost.  Spaulding, David. 2003b. Investment Performance Attribution. McGraw-Hill.  Spaulding, David. 2003b.

Spaulding, David. 2003/2004. “Demystifying the Interaction Effect.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (2): 49–54.  The author explains that the interaction effect is the product of two deci- sions: selection and allocation. Despite pointing out potentially misleading results caused by calculating interaction (for example, mispriced securities and/or investing in sectors not in the benchmark), the author determines that on balance, it is better to calculate interaction, take the time to do some analysis, and then decide where to assign it—better yet would be to  show the interaction as a separate item and prepare to explain it.  Spaulding, David. 2016. “Performance Attribution Risk-Adjusted: Why It Makes Sense and How to Do It.” Journal of Performance Measurement 20 (4):  42–56.

Spaulding, David, and Stephen Campisi. 2007. “A Case for Money-Weighted Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 11 (Performance Attribution  Supplement: 8–20.  The authors make the case for money-weighted attribution. Since cash flow movements are a factor that defines the investment process, cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation process and should not be neutralised, as they are in a time-weighted calculation. The authors point out that transaction-based attribution methodologies that use modified Dietz calculations are, in fact, money-weighted attributions  over a single period.  Stannard, John C. 1997. “Measuring Investment Returns of Portfolios Containing Derivatives: Part II—Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 1 (3): 5–9.  This paper demonstrates that a derivatives position can be represented as a series of (normally, two or more) notional asset exposures representing physi- cal securities and any implied borrowing used to finance the security position. Standard performance attribution techniques can be used on notional assets  to represent the derivatives in terms of the underlying investment decisions.  Surz, Ronald J. 1999/2000. “Attribution with Style.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 4 (2): 50–64.  This paper makes the case that manager style is a powerful determinant of performance. Style-based attribution produces much more reliable indicators than sector-based methods because most investment managers manage to a style rather than to some mix of economic sectors. Using sector-  based attribution analysis can produce significantly misleading inferences.  Van Breukelen, Gerard. 2000. “Fixed Income Attribution.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 4 (4): 61–68.  This article discusses performance attribution for fixed-income portfolios. The starting point is a top-down decision structure, which means that the  portfolio’s overall duration is decided first, followed by the distribution  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

After the market allocation, individual issue selection is  measured. Currency allocation is independent and measured separately.  Wagner, Wayne H., and Dennis A.

The Best of Both Worlds.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (2): 10–18.  The author lists the pros and cons of the arithmetic and geometric methods and concludes the geometric method is clearly superior in almost every way. The author states that the arithmetic method produces a distortion when applied to multiple-period attribution because returns naturally compound geometrically, not arithmetically. Nothing can be done to improve the arithmetic method to overcome this basic fact. What is not so well known is that the arithmetic method produces a distortion even for a single period when multiple currencies are involved. In conclusion, the author suggests a  method that is computed geometrically and presented arithmetically.  Wong, Celia. 2007. “Comparing Arithmetic and Geometric Attribution.” In Advanced Portfolio Attribution Analysis, edited by Carl Bacon, 135–59. Risk  Books.  The author provides a new arithmetic formula that eliminates the drawbacks of multiperiod arithmetic attribution with no need for linking algorithms. She also presents an easy way of converting between arithmetic and geometric attribution so that expressing attribution results is just a  matter of preference.

Hensel, Ezra, and Ilkiw (1991) defined attribution as the “mathemati- cal process of explaining an investment return by relating it to the different risk-taking decisions implicit in the portfolio, and the extent to which each of those risks was rewarded or penalized in the capital markets” (p. 66). Colin (2014) said that the purpose of attribution is to disentangle the fund’s overall  return into the component returns generated by each risk.  In other words, attribution measures which of your investment decisions about the portfolio’s underlying risks worked and which did not. This infor- mation is critical business intelligence for anyone involved in selecting, man- aging, or marketing investments. As the authors noted above, Fischer and Wermers (2013) considered attribution analysis to be the “description and the quantification of key factors on the returns of investment portfolios” (p. 395). DiBartolomeo (2003) considered performance attribution to be the process of disentangling component portions of the observed returns to draw conclu-  sions about the strengths and weaknesses of the investment process.  Note that these definitions are similar. The central question of an attribu- tion analysis is thus the following: To which investment decisions can the active  return of a portfolio relative to its benchmark be traced over a given period?  Formally, Bacon (2008) stated that “performance attribution is a tech- nique used to quantify the excess return of a portfolio against its benchmark into the active decisions of the investment decision process” (p. 117). Murira and Sierra (2006) considered performance attribution the ex post complement  to the ex ante risk decomposition provided by the risk measurement process.  “Performance attribution” is, therefore, perhaps a misleading term: As these descriptions suggest, the excess, active, or relative return is examined,  not the whole of the return (or absolute return). “Relative return attribution”  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Absolute attri- bution, or simply contribution analysis, would explain the sources of return of',\n",
       " 'a portfolio in isolation rather than in comparison with a benchmark.  As described in Bacon (2008), attribution analysis is a critical manage- ment tool for several key stakeholders in the asset management process. Above all, it is the main tool for performance analysts because it allows them to ensure that the return is correct. It allows them to participate in the invest- ment decision process by enabling them to demonstrably add value and thus justify their salary and effort. Return attribution, together with risk analy- sis, is the tool that allows the analyst to understand the sources of return in the portfolio and to communicate that understanding to portfolio managers,  senior managers, and asset owners.  Investment management firms themselves, and the portfolio managers they employ, are also major users of attribution analysis. Attribution analy- sis provides a good starting point for a dialogue with asset owners on the positive and negative aspects of recent performance. Attribution analysis can be used aggressively to identify underperformance early and provide clients with a thorough explanation of underperformance and, hopefully, a rationale for improving performance. Attribution analysis is also crucial in gaining the confidence of asset owners by demonstrating a good understanding of the  drivers of performance.  Portfolio managers inhabit the front office of asset management firms; typically, performance analysts inhabit the middle office. The back office is also able to use daily, security-level attribution, however, as a diagnostic tool  for identifying pricing and transaction errors.  Bacon (2008) also stated that “senior management take an active interest in attribution analysis to provide them with a tool to monitor their portfolio managers. They will be keen to identify performance outliers—good or bad—  and to ensure that value is added consistently across the firm” (p. 117).  Hence, attribution analysis has numerous uses across a wide range of',\n",

Lord (1997) suggested that the characteristics of a good attribution sys-  tem would include the following:  ¢ aconsistent approach for analysing returns,  a consistent approach for analysing returns,  e asolid theoretical framework for valuation,  a solid theoretical framework for valuation,  e the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,  the ability to analyse portfolios and indexes consistently,  attribution factors consistent with decision variables of the portfolio strat-  egy process,  2  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Performance Attribution  • summary attribution analysis constructed from security details, which  themselves should be available for inspection,  e transactions, and  transactions, and  • robust analytic systems and high-quality data to provide meaningful  attribution results.  Murira and Sierra (2006) suggested that there is general agreement that  an attribution framework must meet two key requirements:  1. It should be consistent with the investment decision-making process of the portfolio. Performance attribution is most useful if it mirrors the investment management process because, in that case, it enables the iden-  tification and explanation of the sources of excess return.  2. It should be compatible with the organization’s performance measurement and risk measurement systems. Managers would have difficulty making effective use of the information provided by the performance attribution process if the data being explained by this process were inconsistent with  the data originating from the internal risk and performance systems.  As in many literature reviews, here the approach to the task is historical— beginning with the first attempts at performance measurement, about a half-  century ago, and progressing to the present.  Early Development  Arguably, comparative performance measurement began with Dietz’s (1966) Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance and the Bank Administration Institute (BAI 1968) report Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison. The purpose of the BAI study was to develop methods of comparing the performance of pension funds to differentiate between the abilities of their respective managers. The main  conclusions of their study are still relevant:  1. Performance measurement returns should be based on market value, not',\n",

Interestingly, Eugene Fama was later invited to write and  wrote the chapter on risk for this report.  Fama Decomposition. Fama was the first to fully delve into the sub- ject of attribution analysis, which he did in “Components of Investment Performance” (Fama 1972). In this seminal paper, Fama suggested breaking down observed return into the part resulting from ability to pick the best securities at a given level of risk (which he at the time called “selectivity”; now, it is often referred to as “selection return”) and the part that is the result of predictions of general market price movements—that is, the return from  systematic risk—as follows:  (1)  Excess  Selectivity  Systematic risk  where:  average portfolio return average market or benchmark return portfolio systematic risk  average risk-free rate  If a portfolio is fully diversified, it incurs no specific risk and the total portfolio risk will equal the systematic risk. Portfolio managers will give up diversification, however, to seek additional return. Therefore, the return from selectivity can be broken down into (1) the additional return required to jus- tify sacrificing a given amount of diversification and (2) the net return from selectivity (the remainder of the manager’s value added). The return from  selectivity is equivalent to Jensen’s alpha,  .  The term “diversification” (used in a different context from the one we would understand today) “is the return required to justify moving away from the benchmark and taking on specific risk” (Bacon 2013, p. 88). To calcu- late this diversification return, you first have to calculate the effective beta required such that systematic risk alone is equivalent to the total portfolio  risk. This beta is the Fama beta, calculated as follows:  B.=—, o  4  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  (2)  Performance Attribution  where:',\n",

The net return from selectivity (“net selectivity,” for short) is the remain- ing return from selectivity after deducting the amount of return required to  justify not being fully diversified:  Net selectivity = Selectivity — Diversification.  Net selectivity = Selectivity – Diversification.  Net selectivity = Sy,, =a—d.  Net selectivity =  If net selectivity is negative, the portfolio manager has failed to justify the  loss of diversification.  Timing is the return from the manager’s variations in systematic risk  (beta) around some policy or target amount:  (4)  where B, = the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  where  the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  Figure 1 illustrates Fama’s decomposition for portfolio A. represents the return from systematic risk (conventional beta) plus the risk-free rate, and  represents the return from the Fama beta plus the risk-free rate.  Fama’s (1972) “Components of Investment Performance” is the first paper to seriously analyse the sources of return of an investment portfolio and,  therefore, represents the birth of attribution analysis.  Notional Funds. In response to the BAI (1968) paper, a working group was set up towards the end of 1970 by the Society of Investment Analysts  (SIA) in the United Kingdom to make recommendations on the subject  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Its approach, eventually published in 1972 (SIA 1972), had two aims: (1) the determination of a standard method of calculating a portfolio’s return, so that funds could be fairly compared, and (2) the decomposition of the performance of the fund into two components—selection of individual stocks and selection of stock sectors. The first aim is achieved by calculating the time-weighted rate of return using a simple approximation (which later became known as the analyst’s test method and ultimately became redundant as more accurate time-weighted returns became available). The second aim, the analysis of performance, is produced by constructing “notional funds” based on market  indexes and comparing them with actual funds.  This early work dealt with equity-market sectors as the macro level of selection and securities within the sectors as the micro level, but common practice now is to regard asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as the macro level and securities within the asset class as the micro level. Thus, our discussion  will proceed from this latter starting point.  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  e a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  e apartly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  a partly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  Note that the actual fund consists of actual returns and actual weights. The fully restrained fund (sometimes called the “fully notional fund”) represents the return on the policy portfolio—that is, the strategic bench-  mark or policy weights set by the asset owner (represented by the pension  6  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The performance of a fund—in this case, a pension fund—thus depends on two factors: the selection of asset classes (typically, now described as asset allocation) and the selection of securities within an asset class. (As noted ear- lier, this analysis can also be applied to sector allocation and stock selection within sectors in an exactly parallel way.) The contribution of each of these components can be found by breaking down the transition from the actual  fund to the fully restrained fund as shown in Table 1.',\n",

All rights reserved.  7  Performance Attribution  The success of the manager’s asset allocation is measured by comparing the performance of the partly restrained fund with that of the fully restrained fund. The success of the manager’s security selection is measured by compar-  ing the performance of the actual fund with that of the partly restrained fund.  The SIA (1972) report is thus crucial because it introduces the concepts of macro and micro levels of manager decision making and intermediate  notional portfolios to calculate these effects.  In “Investment Performance of Pension Funds” (Holbrook 1977), the British actuary J.P. Holbrook, in effect, pulled together the BAI (1968) report, Fama’s (1972) decomposition, and the SIA (1972) report. This virtu- ally unknown paper provides the foundation for much of the development in performance analysis that followed. Directing his advice to pension fund  trustees, Holbrook defined the decision-making process as follows:  The practical management of a pension fund investment portfolio involves  decisions at three levels.  i) Policy, i.e. the proportions of the assets which, as a long-term aim, the trustees wish to hold in the different investment mar- kets. The fundamental element of policy is the split between equity-type and fixed-interest investments. Definition of pol- icy may extend to a split of equity-type investments between UK equities, overseas equities and properties, specific pro- portions being set for each. If the trustees are not experts in long-term investment, they will tend to formulate policy in discussion with specialist advisers; it is gratifying to record that actuaries who advise on the financing of pension schemes  are increasingly becoming involved in such discussions.  ii) Strategy, i.e. decisions to depart from the policy proportions in the light of current market conditions, including decisions to hold part of the fund on short-term deposit. The trustees will usually seek advice from experts in the various markets regarding the short-term outlook, up to the time of the next investment meeting and over the next year or so. Except where trustees delegate strategic decisions to managers and advisers, investment meetings are usually held at short regular intervals, and arrangements are made for special meetings whenever it is thought that there has been a material change in market prospects. Often trustees authorize the managers concerned to determine the timing of purchases; thus, a manager is able to retain part of the assets entrusted to him in the form of short-',\n",

Performance Attribution  iii) Selection, i.e. the choice of the particular investments to hold, buy or sell within the various markets. Again, practice varies; many trustees give their managers carte blanche in this area—  some keep close control over day-to-day transactions. (p. 20)  Holbrook went on to describe the trustees’ needs. First, they need to know whether the fund performed well, moderately, or badly. This knowledge requires the calculation of return, comparisons with market returns, and con-  sideration of risk:  The performance of the fund as a whole, and within the different markets and sectors, must be examined separately. Secondly, the trustees need to be advised on the reasons for their fund’s performance; this may be inves- tigated by analysing the results to show contributions to total performance made by policy, strategy, and selection decisions. Finally, the trustees need help in interpreting the results as a guide to future action. Identification of points of strength and weakness in past performance may lead to reconsid- eration of policy and practice, of the decision-making process, and possibly  to a change of manager. (p. 21)  To facilitate the breakdown of returns into policy, strategic, and selection  decisions, Holbrook suggested the return calculation of three notional funds:  based on the model, based on the trustees’ policy proportions, and  based on actual allocations.  Then, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by  Then, the geometric excess return, g, for the whole fund is given by  (8)  The first factor represents the contribution to total performance resulting from the decision to adopt a policy that differs from the equity and fixed- interest proportions in the model [the industry standard allocation between equity and fixed income at the time]. The second, the contribution from the strategic decision to depart from policy proportions. The third, the contribution from selection decisions for the fixed-interest and equity  sectors taken together. (Holbrook 1977, p. 31)  This passage is the first articulation of successive notional portfolios each of which isolates one step in the investment decision process. The fact that it  was written in 1977 shows how far ahead of his time Holbrook was.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The next major development in attribution analysis stems from a series of papers written in the 1980s that collectively describe  Brinson attribution.  Brinson, Hood, and Beebower’s (1986) “Determinants of Portfolio Performance” is perhaps the most well-known paper on attribution. It pro- vided the name for the most common type of equity attribution model used today: the Brinson model. Despite being a relatively short paper, it made two  contributions:  1. The general framework used to decompose total portfolio returns. Brinson et al. (1986) suggested a model for breaking down the arithmetic return in excess of the benchmark (r – b) under the assumption of a standard top-down investment decision process in which the portfolio manager seeks to add value through both timing and security selection. Figure 2 illustrates  their framework for analysing portfolio returns.  Quadrant I represents the policy benchmark return for a period—that is, the return on a hypothetical portfolio wherein the asset-class weights are those in long-term investment policy and the returns are those of the  asset-class benchmarks  .  Quadrant I (9)  Quadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.  Quadrant II represents the return effects of policy and timing.  In timing, the portfolio manager seeks to add value by holding asset- class (or sector) weights in the portfolio that are different from the asset-class benchmark weights. An asset-class weight in the portfolio that is greater than the benchmark weight for that asset class would be described as overweight and a lesser weight would be described as underweight. Clearly, the portfolio manager will aim to overweight well-performing asset classes (or sectors) and  underweight poorly performing asset classes.  Quadrant II minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-  tracted value from timing only.  10  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.

In security selection, the portfolio manager seeks to add value  by selecting individual securities within the asset class or sector.  Quadrant III minus Quadrant I, therefore, describes the added or sub-  tracted value from selection only.  Quadrant IV represents the actual return of the managed portfolio.  Quadrant IV represents the actual return of the managed portfolio.  Brinson et al. (1986) called the remaining term “other” or the “cross-  product” term. It is now more commonly considered to be “interaction.”  Quadrant IV minus Quadrant III minus Quadrant II plus Quadrant I  represents the added or subtracted value from interaction.  2. In a more controversial practice, the framework is used on a sample of pension funds to demonstrate that most of the difference in returns among pension funds is the result of policy decisions, not timing or selection. This  use of the framework is responsible for much of its fame.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  11  Performance Attribution  Attribution Formulas. Brinson et al. (1986) may be the better known of the “Brinson papers,” but the more important paper in terms of the development of attribution is “Measuring Non-US Equity Portfolio Performance” by Brinson and Fachler (1985). Again, it is a short paper, but it documented for the first time the formulas required to calculate individual',\n",
       " 'attribution effects:  n Allocation (Brinson and Fachler [1985] used the term “market selec-  tion”). The contribution to excess return from asset allocation in the ith sector is  A, =(w, -W.)x(b,-6).  n Selection. The contribution to excess return from stock selection in  sector i is  S,=W,x(r,-4).  n Interaction (Brinson and Fachler used the term “cross-product”). The  contribution to excess return from interaction in sector i is  I, =(w;, -W,)x(7,—4;).  With a few modifications, these formulas provide the basic foundations for most of the attribution analysis used today. The terms “asset allocation,” “security selection,” and “interaction” are now universal and familiar to all. At the time, however, allocation might have been described as “timing,” “market selection,” or “weighting.” To establish when the term “allocation” was first used is difficult, but Cocks (1972) was among the first. He defined it as “all those decisions by which the portfolio manager allocates his funds among the selected securities (or broad classes of securities)” (p. 3). Asset allocation spe- cifically locates the decision process in what asset classes to hold and in what weights, and this terminology is associated with Ibbotson and Sinquefield  (1982), although no one knows when the term was first used.  Use of the term “interaction” (or “other” or “cross-product”) is difficult to establish, but certainly, by the early 1990s, “asset allocation,” “security selec-  tion,” and “interaction” had become the most commonly used terms.  The Brinson et al. (1986) paper did not provide a formula for individual attribution effects, but the following variation of the allocation formula is  associated with that paper:  12  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

(13)  (13)  It seems unlikely that Brinson et al. (1986) intended this interpretation, and the Brinson and Fachler (1985) variant for asset allocation is far more common and better aligned with most investment decision processes. If the Brinson et al. definition is used, the contribution from asset allocation will be positive for any overweight sector in which the sector return is positive, but it will be positive when using the Brinson–Fachler definition only if the sector  return exceeds the overall benchmark return.  Graphically, the Brinson et al. (1986) method is easier to illustrate for each sector i than the Brinson and Fachler (1985) method, as shown in Figure 3. The contribution to portfolio return from sector i is the total area , and the contribution from the benchmark alone is area . In this example the total contribution from the portfolio in sector i is greater than',\n",

In this particular example, , and ;  therefore, all three contributions are positive.  The Brinson and Fachler (1985) method illustrated in Figure 4 is a little less intuitive. As stated in Bacon (2008), “We observe no change to the areas representing selection and interaction but allocation is now described by the  area  ” (p. 125).  Figure 3.

The same formulas as those suggested by Brinson–Fachler and associated with Brinson et al. (1986) can be found in a formal discussion response to a paper by Kingston (1973) presented to the Faculty of Actuaries on 14 October 1974, more than 10 years before the  Brinson–Fachler paper was published.  The formulas may well have been developed prior to the publication of the Brinson and Fachler (1985), Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), Brinson, Singer, and Beebower (1991), and Singer (1996) papers, but collectively these papers established attribution analysis as an important aid in the critical review of active strategies and decision-making processes for asset managers,  asset consultants, and asset owners.  Interaction. Interaction is a controversial effect. Most authors—for example, Laker (2001), Spaulding (2003/2004), Campisi (2004b), and Bacon (2008)—would agree that the interaction effect is a directly calculated term, not a residual, but what does it mean? . . . It is certainly not intuitive. As noted, Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), arguably the first definers of the interaction effect, rather unhelpfully described this effect as “other” or a “cross-product”; they did not use the  term “interaction.” By the early 1990s, the term had become fairly universal  14  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  in the literature, however, probably popularised by the software providers of the time. The interaction effect is clearly a cross-product, the combination of',\n",
       " 'allocation and selection decisions.  Laker (2000) suggested “that when calculated properly, the interaction term plays a valuable role in explaining a portfolio’s active performance, and indeed that sometimes it is clearly more explanatory than the other attributes” (p. 43). Spaulding (2003/2004) was more nuanced in his comments, despite pointing out potentially misleading results (from mispriced securities or investing in sectors not in the benchmark). On balance, Spaulding suggested, it is best to calculate interaction, take the time to do some analysis, and then decide where to assign it, or better yet, show the interaction as a separate item and prepare to explain it. Campisi (2004b) and Bacon (2008) were less supportive of using the interaction effect; they suggested that it is not an active part of the investment decision process and, therefore, need not be calculated. Like many asset managers in practice, they suggested including  interaction in the selection effect.  The decision to include interaction with stock selection is not arbitrary. If you assume that asset allocation decisions are taken first in a top-down investment process, then the attribution from stock selection can be derived from Quadrant IV minus Quadrant II in Figure 2 and interaction need not be calculated at all. The decision to include interaction with stock selection is,  therefore, the direct result of the investment decision process.  The contribution to stock selection in the ith sector is now  The contribution to stock selection in the ith sector is now  S,=w,x(r,-4,),  (14)  (14)  and Figure 4 can now be redrawn as shown in Figure 5 with selection repre-  sented by the area  .  Multiperiod Analysis  The attribution models described so far work well for single periods with static data. No obvious way exists, however, to combine attribution effects over time. Because of the multiplicative (geometric) nature of returns, arithmetic excess returns fail to add up over multiple periods. Carino (1999, p. 5) eloquently  explained the problem this way:  Over multiple periods, the natural way to combine returns is to compound  them. The compounded return R over t periods is  R=(14r)x(+n) xox (Ltn )-1. [15]  [15]  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  15  Performance Attribution',\n",

Singer (1996, p. 54) made the same point:  Singer (1996, p. 54) made the same point:  While it is tempting to simply add the individual periods to obtain multipe-  riod attribution results, it is wrong:  [17]  Nor is it satisfactory to compound the single period return differences because  that result does not equal the difference in compounded returns either.

Obviously, if multiperiod arithmetic excess returns do not add up, then clearly arithmetic attribution that adds up for sin- gle periods will not add up for multiple periods. Value added through active management decisions compounds over time, a fact that should be accounted for in multiperiod frameworks. Naturally, the end users of attribution analy-  ses expect their analyses to add up without residuals.  Solutions can be categorized into two types, smoothing algorithms, such as those described by Carino (1999) and Menchero (2000), and linking algorithms (sometimes described as “dollar attribution”), such as those in GRAP (1997),  Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede, Foresti, and Matheos (2002).1  The authors of each paper suggested that their method was the most appropriate to implement. Smoothing algorithms, in effect, take the result- ing residual and methodically redistribute it across other factors. Carino (1999) used logarithms, and Menchero (2000) redistributed the residual in an optimised way that minimised the change in any single factor. GRAP (1997), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002) compounded attribution effects through time and achieved identical results, but cru- cially, their methods are order dependent: If the time periods are reversed, the attribution result will change. Frongello acknowledged the order dependence but regarded it as a strength; others, including Laker (2002),  would describe it as a weakness.  «  Davies and Laker (2001) suggested an “exact” method for using the Brinson model to calculate attributes over multiple periods at a portfolio level, but not sector level. Because of the so-called exact nature of their model, they suggested it would be helpful to evaluate the accuracy of other pro- posed methods by comparison with their method at the total portfolio level. Many articles have been written critiquing and defending existing methods and offering refinements and new methods, including Banchik (2004/2005), Carino (2002), David (2012/2013), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), Jiang and Saenz (2014/2015), Kirievsky and Kirievsky (2000, 2004), Laker (2002, 2005), Menchero (2003), Mirabelli (2000/2001), Reztsov (2011/2012), Spaulding (2002), and Wong (2003/2004, 2007). By and large, however, the end user has proven to be unconcerned about these black box approaches, provided that the multiperiod arithmetic attribution adds up without residu- als. Frongello (2006) concluded that “although the mathematics can differ greatly from one method to another, the story told by the resulting attribution  is the same regardless of the method” (p. 366).  1Software providers have typically found solutions but often keep their methods more or less',\n",

Some would suggest that the problem with multiperiod attribution analysis stems from an incorrect definition of excess return itself. Bacon (2002) defined the arithmetic excess return as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the ini- tial value of the portfolio. That work defined the geometric excess return, , as the profit in excess of the notional fund expressed as a percentage of the final value of the notional fund. In other words, the geo- metric excess return measures the added value in terms of a percentage of the value of the notional fund assets at the end of the period, not the start, which  is surely the main concern of any asset owner.  Bacon (2002) suggested that geometric excess returns are preferable because they are compoundable (geometric excess returns compound over multiple periods without residuals), they are convertible among currencies, and they are proportionate. The preferred definition of excess return should determine the choice of attribution methodology. Bain (1996), Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998), and Bacon (2002) each presented a geometric attribution model. Although developed independently and presented in dif- ferent ways, the models are, in fact, identical, which is an indication of the robustness of the approach. Geometric models built on the idea of successive notional portfolios can be found in Holbrook (1977), Hymans and Mulligan  (1980), and Allen (1991). As shown in Figure 6, each successive portfolio  Figure 6.

Step I represents the strategic, policy, or benchmark return. The difference between Step II and Step I represents the value added by active asset alloca- tion, and the difference between Step III and Step II represents the value added by security selection. More steps can be introduced for more complex,  multistep investment decision processes.  In the geometric attribution model, the difference between each step is  calculated geometrically:  (19)  Because geometric excess returns compound through time and because geometric allocation effects and geometric selection effects compound together within each period, geometric allocation and geometric selection must also compound through time. Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and  Bacon (2002) provided formulas for individual attribution effects as follows:  n Allocation. The contribution to geometric excess return from asset',\n",

The contribution to geometric excess return from stock  selection in sector i  is  (21)  or  or  (22)  In geometric attribution, interaction is typically included in the selection effect, although a geometric interaction effect can be derived if desired (see  Weber 2018).  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  19  Performance Attribution  Burnie et al. (1998) described perhaps the most well-known geometric methodology. Interestingly, they made the case for geometric attribution in a single-period context, not necessarily a multiperiod one. They also drew a distinction between top-down and bottom-up investment decision processes. A bottom-up investment decision process, they noted, assumes that security  selection takes precedence over asset allocation or is performed first.  Weber (2018) would consider the Bain (1996), Burnie et al. (1998), and Bacon (2002) models to be semi-geometric models. The reason is that although total selection and allocation effects compound to the geometric excess return, the effects within selection and allocation are still arithmeti- cally calculated. Menchero (2001/2002) offered a fully geometric model in  which individual selection and allocation effects compound through time.  Multicurrency Attribution  In this section, we consider three works specifically directed to performance  attribution in currency management.  Allen (1991). In an article entitled “Performance Attribution for Global Equity Portfolios,” Allen took the Holbrook (1977) concept of successive intermediate portfolios and applied it in a multicurrency environment. Allen stated that the trick to quantifying the impact of each type of active manage- ment decision involved calculating the return on a theoretical portfolio where one type of decision had been neutralised. Comparison of the return on the manager’s portfolio (where no decisions had been neutralised) with the return on the portfolio where a class of management decisions had been neutralised  allowed the impact of those neutralised decisions to be measured.  When carried out correctly, this process is quite neat. No unexplained residuals remain. Allen’s article provides a framework for quantifying the marginal impact that both policy decisions and active management decisions have on the performance of a global equity portfolio. At the heart of this framework is the assumption that the total return on an actively managed  global equity portfolio is explained by seven types of decisions:  1. the choice, at the policy level, of the unhedged dollar-denominated index  against which the active equity manager is to be measured  2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country  2. security selection decisions by the active manager within each country  3. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based  on the manager’s expectation of the country’s equity returns  4. overweighting or underweighting of a country relative to the index based  on the manager’s expectation of the country’s currency returns  20  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

This method allows for evaluation of the long-term contribution of a selected  investment strategy to total return.  Ankrim and Hensel (1992, 1994). In 1992, Ankrim and Hensel pub- lished a Russell Research Commentary setting out a framework for multicur- rency performance attribution. This article, building on work by Brinson and Fachler (1985), separated out the impact of currency decisions—in particular, it recognised the significance of differential interest rates in currency decision  making. Ankrim and Hensel proposed  a method of performance attribution that retains the simplicity and intui- tive appeal of the Brinson and Fachler approach but breaks the returns from currency into two components: one that recognizes the opportunity cost of returns achievable in forward-currency markets and a second that measures the return attributable to the currency being less than fully hedged, both in the portfolio and in the benchmark with which the portfolio is com-  pared. (p. 2)  In the 1992 paper, Ankrim and Hensel identified three reasons that  including currency exposure in performance attribution causes problems:  First, and most obvious, it alters the returns ultimately received by the cli- ent. In Brinson and Fachler [1985], all returns are denominated in the home currency, but this convention makes it impossible to separate the contribu- tion to returns made by the manager’s country and security selection deci-',\n",
       " 'sions from the impact of currency translation gains and losses.  Second, in practice, many portfolios have some portion (but not necessarily all) of their currency exposure hedged away. This requires an approach to performance attribution that allows the proportion of currency exposure  hedged to be variable.  Third, even if a portfolio is completely hedged, the client may choose to  adopt a benchmark that is less than fully hedged. (p. 2)  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  21  Performance Attribution  The authors defined two components of currency return: currency surprise and the forward premium. Currency surprise is uncertain, but the forward premium element is not because it depends on interest rate differentials at the  time of purchase:  Any approach to multicurrency attribution that lumps the forward premium and currency surprise together will credit positive performance to manag- ers who have large exposures in countries with positive forward premiums. Such an approach would penalize managers who hold large positions in  countries with negative forward premiums. (p. 12)  Karnosky and Singer (1994). Arguably the single most important paper published on attribution in the 1990s is Karnosky and Singer. This paper not only demonstrates that managing multicurrency portfolios is sub-optimal if currency is not managed independently but also provides a framework for calculating attribution effects, while critically, taking into account interest rate differentials. Karnosky and Singer resolved the issue of market and currency compounding by using continuously compounded returns in their model, admittedly this is only referred to in the small print, and solved the forward premium concern by thinking in terms of a “return premium” above local interest rates. Karnosky and Singer explained that the term “return premium” is used, rather than the more familiar “risk premium,” to make a subtle distinction in the underlying cash return. “Risk premium” refers to the return of a risky asset in excess of the return of a riskless asset, but in the authors’ analysis, the premiums depend on forward contracts with long maturities, where risk is probably not the dominant factor; hence, the  term “return premium” is used.  Karnosky and Singer’s framework demonstrates that separate currency and market strategies can be implemented within a global portfolio in which a specific currency weight is different from the weight of the associated country market. In effect, the authors applied the standard Brinson methodology twice—once to global portfolios by using local-return premiums (rather than simply local returns) to measure allocation and selection effects and, separately, to cash returns in the base currency of the asset owner in order to  calculate independent currency effects, as shown in Figure 7.  22  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Types of Attribution  Three types of attribution have been identified, and they are characterized by  the information used to calculate attribution effects, as follows:  1. Holdings-based attribution.  1. Holdings-based attribution.  Holdings-based or position-based attribution is calculated by analysing the underlying beginning-period holdings of the portfolio only. Typically, holdings-based attribution is calculated from monthly, weekly, or daily  data, with the shorter time periods leading to greater accuracy.  2. Transaction-based attribution.  2. Transaction-based attribution.  Transaction-based attribution is calculated by using both the holdings of the portfolio and the transactions (purchases and sales) that occurred  during the evaluation period.  Returns-based attribution.  3. Returns-based attribution.  Returns-based (or factor) attribution uses the historical returns of the total portfolio and/or individual securities to decompose the total return into multiple factors. The multifactor model is a regression equation that describes the way a particular security or portfolio reacts to industry sec-  tor, fundamental, macroeconomic, and other market factors.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  23  Performance Attribution  Asset-Grouping Attribution. The type of attribution favoured by the asset manager or asset owner will vary according to the investment decision process, investment objective, quality and availability of data, cost and time considerations, complexity, and reporting objective. Holdings-based and transaction-based attributions are mutually exclusive, and the choice is based on (for holdings based) cost, quality of data, ease of use, and rapid implemen- tation against (for transaction based) the advantages of reconciliation to the client-reported return, completeness, and accuracy. A number of authors— Giguere (2003), Bonafede and McCarthy (2003), Spaulding (2003a), Menchero and Hu (2003), and Bacon (2008)—argued for one approach or another. Spaulding, without an eye to existing software (and thus genuinely independently), concluded that the question “which is better?” does not have a simple answer. Too many variables are at work; in the end, the choice comes down to user preference. In later research, Spaulding (2018) showed that the residual implicit in holdings-based attribution can be extensive and is not nec- essarily correlated with turnover. Both holdings-based and transaction-based attribution are also described as “asset-grouping” or “variance type” attribu- tion, reflecting their requirements for asset allocation data and variance from',\n",
       " 'benchmark data.  Attribution Based on Returns. Returns-based attribution, in contrast to the asset-grouping approach, might complement either holdings- or trans- action-based attribution in that it might reveal unexpected biases and make communication easier for asset managers using a factor-focused investment decision process. Returns-based attribution is a direct descendant of Fama (1972) decomposition, which is a single-factor model, via Sharpe (1988) and Fama and French (1993)—both three-factor models that include a general market factor together with a size and value factor—and Carhart (1997), a  four-factor model that introduced a momentum factor.  Amenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:  Amenc, Sfeir, and Martellini (2003) described four types of factor models:  1. Implicit factor model. In this model, some factor analysis (e.g., a principal components analysis) is performed to statistically extract the factors from  the return’s time series. These factors may not be easily interpretable.  2. Explicit macro factor model. In this approach, macroeconomic variables  are used as factors.  3. Explicit micro factor model. In this approach, microeconomic attributes  are used as factors.  4. Explicit index factor model. In this approach, stock market indexes  (including style subindexes of the market) are used as factors.  24  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Within this framework, Amenc and Le Sourd (2003) described a wide  range of multifactor models in detail.  William F. Sharpe, who is associated with style attribution starting with his 1988 paper (see Sharpe 1988, 1992), used a 12-factor model to determine the passive return of a portfolio with the same style as the active asset man- ager. The difference between the actual portfolio return and the passive return with the same style would be a result of the manager’s selection ability. This type of style analysis provides a natural method for constructing appropriate style benchmarks. Sharpe (1988) stated that the usefulness of the asset-class model depends on the asset classes chosen for implementation. It is desirable',\n",
       " 'that asset classes  e be mutually exclusive,  be mutually exclusive,  e be exhaustive, and  be exhaustive, and  e have returns that differ.  have returns that differ.  Each asset class should be proxied by a market capitalization–weighted index of the securities in it, and no security should be included in more than one asset class. Also, the asset classes should have low correlations with each other (or different standard deviations if correlations are high, as is the case in  many fixed-income styles or asset subclasses).  Surz (1999/2000) suggested a holdings-based or transaction-based form of style attribution based on the exclusive style characteristics of the hold- ings in the portfolio and benchmark. Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2005) proposed a regression-based attribution system linked to the parameters from the “Fundamental Law of Active Management” (Grinold and Kahn 1995, pp. 117–35). In a slight oversimplification, the fundamental law says that alpha is a function of manager skill as well as breadth (the number of inde- pendent bets made by the manager). The investigation by Clarke et al. (2005) indicated that the “law can be used to estimate and interpret the regression- based results without substantial error while showing the investor how much of the active return is related to forecasting accuracy and how much is noise  related to constraints in constructing the portfolio” (p. 81).  Returns-based or regression-based attribution has the following  characteristics:  e It does not necessarily require the composition of the portfolio.

Risk-Adjusted Attribution  Campisi (2000) listed the characteristics of a good performance attribution  system as follows:  • It is consistent with the investment process and the manager’s decision-  making process.  • It uses a benchmark that reflects the manager’s strategic (long-term) asset  allocation.  e It measures the effect of the manager’s tactical (short-term) allocation shifts.  It measures the effect of the manager’s tactical (short-term) allocation shifts.  e It adjusts attribution of return for systematic risk(s).  It adjusts attribution of return for systematic risk(s).  Campisi (2000) suggested that many attribution systems fail at least one of these criteria and some fail all of them. Often, this failure occurs because returns are not adjusted for systematic risk and style (high vs. low beta, large vs. small size, value vs. growth orientation, etc.). Simply applying the alloca- tion/selection model often results in attribution results that are not neces- sarily meaningful because they do not reflect the investment process or the risks that drove return over the evaluation period. Risk-adjusted attribution is the real Cinderella of attribution analysis: In practice, risk-adjusted attri- bution is rarely performed. Ankrim (1992) proposed a form of risk-adjusted attribution using beta, as did Bacon (2008) and Obeid (2005). Kophamel (2003), thinking in terms of the volume of “performance cubes” rather than the familiar “performance areas” of the Brinson model, proposed attribution analysis in three dimensions. Spaulding (2016) suggested adjusting for total risk rather than systematic risk—in effect, attributing M2 returns (described',\n",
       " 'in Modigliani 1997).2 Rather satisfactorily, Fisher and D’Alessandro (2019)  2Modigliani risk-adjusted performance (also known as M2, M2, the Modigliani–Modigliani measure, or RAP) is a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of some investment portfolio. It measures the returns of the portfolio adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of  some benchmark (e.g., the market).  26  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  took attribution full circle and tied risk-adjusted attribution back to the origi-  nal Fama decomposition.  Van Breukelen (2000) suggested a form of risk-adjusted attribution for fixed-income portfolios that takes into account the weighted duration “bets” of portfolio managers. Van Breukelen described a top-down investment deci- sion process in which overall duration is the first decision followed by a mar- ket allocation decision—a combination of country weight and duration—and finally, an issue selection decision within country. Currency effects are mea- sured separately using a Karnosky and Singer (1994) type of approach. The value added by each step of the decision process is measured by using a series  of reference or successive notional portfolios.  Fixed-Income Attribution  The simple Brinson model is widely regarded as being insufficient for all but the simplest of fixed-income investment strategies. McLaren (2002) explained that classical attribution models (e.g., Brinson’s model) are inap- propriate for fixed-income portfolio analysis because the allocation decision in equity models does not explicitly account for yield-curve positioning (dura- tion) set by fixed-income managers. This omission is significant because the duration decision, which has no direct equity counterpart, plays an impor- tant role in the fixed-income decision-making process. Campisi (2000) also explained why fixed income needs its own attribution model and pointed out  five critical differences between stocks and bonds:  1. Bonds are temporary lending agreements with a stated maturity, whereas  stocks are permanent investments.  2. Bonds promise a fixed return, with a strictly defined upside if held to maturity; stocks promise uncertain returns and the unlimited upside (and  downside) associated with ownership.  3. Bonds are typically purchased by institutions, which often hold them until maturity. This pattern results in a limited secondary market for bonds. Stock investing takes place in an active secondary market. As a  result, bonds are illiquid compared with stocks.  4. Bond performance is driven by promised income and by changes in market yields: When market yields rise above a bond’s stated yield, the price of that bond falls. As a result, the relevant risk for bonds is sensitivity to changes in yields. Stock performance is driven by the market’s economic sectors, and the principal risks for stocks are (a) sensitivity to the overall market, or beta,  and (b) the individual fortunes of the company invested in.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  27  Performance Attribution  5. Bonds are simply the promise of a stream of cash flows; thus, they are relatively homogeneous in their pricing. For example, bonds with the same maturity and default risk will generally sell at the same price. Therefore, bonds reflect little selection effect. Stock prices, in contrast, respond dramatically to company-specific conditions and thus reflect a',\n",
       " 'large selection effect.  Distinct approaches for fixed-income attribution emerged quite quickly in the early development of attribution. The method described in Wagner and Tito (1977) is derived directly from Fama decomposition, with beta replaced by a systematic risk measure for bonds—namely, duration. In this approach, fixed-income portfolio performance is driven by promised income and by the  effect that changes in yields have on bond prices.  No single, standardised way of defining fixed-income attribution exists. The asset class has more securities than in equity investing, more types of instruments, more variety in investment process, and more quantitative mod- elling requirements. It also has various ways of describing change in the yield curve and a broad array of investment mandates. Murira and Sierra (2006) explained that each of the commercially available systems uses its own partic- ular brand of return attribution. In fact, because of differences in the defini- tion and computation of the factors, different systems often provide different  values for the same return factor.  Other authors have made various contributions to developments in fixed-income attribution—developments often linked to specific invest- ment decision processes or specific software capabilities. These authors include Ramaswamy (2001), Giguere (2005), Colin (2005, 2014), Gillet and Hommolie (2006), Colin, Cubilie, and Bardoux (2006), Silva, de Carvalho,  and Ornelas (2010), Simmons and Karadakov (2013/2014), and Dias (2017).  Figure 8 illustrates the attribution effects in a typical fixed-income attri- bution model. Here, carry represents the return resulting from the passage of time: coupon payments, accrued interest, and rolling down the yield curve (the  pull-to-par effect as the instrument approaches maturity).  In Figure 8, the yield-curve factor represents the changing shape of the yield curve, parallel shift (the impact of a parallel move of the yield curve), twist (a change in slope of the yield curve), and curvature (change in the curvature of the yield curve). Often, twist and curvature are combined and  described as nonparallel changes in the yield curve or curve reshape.  Spread is the return that comes from the widening or narrowing of credit',\n",

Source: Redrawn from a diagram in Dai and Elliot (2014/2015).  Selection effects include convexity, any optionality in the payment of future coupons (important with mortgage-backed securities because mortgages can be prepaid), and a residual. Normally quite small, residuals are classified by Dias (2017) as caused by the model or caused by data errors and systematic or  random effects.  In the other category, the price effect captures the difference in price sources between the bonds in the portfolio and bonds in the benchmark. This is a nonmanagement effect that is a particular problem for fixed income. The trading effect measures the impact of intraday trading. Currency captures the impact of independent currency management, typically by using a Karnosky  and Singer (1994) type of approach.  Fixed-income attribution models can be characterised as either top-down successive portfolio methods (e.g., Van Breukelen 2000) or bottom-up (yield- curve decomposition) methods. Bottom-up methods calculate the impact of yield-curve movements and credit spreads on individual bonds in both the portfolio and the benchmark and aggregate results. Top-down models are perhaps easier to implement and more effective in terms of communicating to  asset owners and other stakeholders.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  29  Performance Attribution  Gillet and Hommolie (2006) described the bottom-up approach as a suc- cessive spread methodology that can be split into two phases. The first phase consists of decomposing the bond prices into its various characteristics (pas- sage of time, evolution of yield curves, variation of spreads). This decomposi- tion is applied simultaneously to the constituents of the portfolio and to the constituents of the benchmark. The second phase consists only of regrouping the separated elements according to the investment decision process (p. 65). Bottom-up models are more difficult and expensive to implement but more  appropriate to the detailed investment decision processes of the front office.  McLaren (2002) offered a geometric fixed-income attribution model, which is not common. Most fixed-income attribution models are arithme- tic in nature, although for the most part, they can be adapted for geometric analysis. The reason may be that excess returns are typically smaller than in equity investing and the underlying benchmark returns less volatile, mak- ing the difference between geometric and arithmetic excess return smaller in',\n",
       " 'magnitude.  Other Attribution Issues  Other issues in attribution pertain to derivatives, transaction costs, frequency  of the analysis, and application to money-weighted returns.  Derivatives. The Brinson model is an incredibly robust methodology. Stannard (1997), Menchero (2002/2003), Bacon (2008), Fischer and Wermers (2013), and Bacon, Thompson, and van der Westhuizen (2018)—all described, using appropriate notional assets and notional returns, how the standard Brinson model can be adapted to handle derivative instruments, including  index futures, options (of various types), and swaps and short positions.  Transaction Costs. Laker (2001) pointed out that transaction costs— explicit costs (such as brokerage and taxes) and implicit costs (such as the bid–offer spread, market impact, and opportunity cost)—are not dealt with explicitly in most performance attribution methods but are normally included within the stock selection effect. In a bottom-up, security-level attribution approach, Laker suggested using the standard Brinson selection formulas at the security level to calculate the impact of transaction costs (explicit and implicit) and intraday timing effects. He suggested that any return difference between an individual security’s daily return and its return in the index must  be the result of transaction costs and timing within the day.  Frequency of Analysis. DiBartolomeo (2003) challenged the assump-  tion that aggregated daily attribution analysis is more appropriate than  30  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Performance Attribution  monthly aggregated analysis and suggested that applying typical attribution methods to daily data draws on assumptions that are highly biased and unre- liable. Beyond simply observing the attributed returns, he believed, you must be able to judge their statistical significance. He suggested that recommend-  ing daily observation rests on four fallacies:  1. Daily performance is economically meaningful. Not necessarily—for example, information is lost by adjusting for the timing of cash flows in',\n",
       " 'time-weighted returns.  2. Daily returns are themselves accurate. Not necessarily—many securities are traded on multiple exchanges or electronic markets at different times, so exactly which closing price is used to compute the daily returns can have a sizable impact. Also, coordinating the timing of corporate actions  such as dividends, spin-offs, and mergers with index providers is difficult.  3. Observations are assumed to be independent. Investment portfolios do not start as a fresh set of management decisions every trading day. Thus the rationale of an independent “start fresh” assumption is weak. Substantial path dependencies are present in portfolio management in practice, which reduces any justification for the assumption of indepen-  dent periodic observations of manager skill.  4. Parametric distributional assumptions are accurate. Most of the aca- demic literature illustrates that the imperfections of our assumptions with respect to quarterly or monthly return data are small, whereas for daily data, we must consistently reject the correctness of the assumptions. In general, daily security returns have fat-tailed distributions, with large return events occurring far more often than would be consistent with a normal distribution. This issue is less of a problem with quarterly or  monthly returns.  DiBartolomeo (2003) concluded that daily performance attribution com- pounds to a more accurate measure of the time-weighted return than attribu- tion using less frequent data—but at a tremendous cost in our ability to judge the statistical significance of the results. Most of the imperfections of daily attributions result in upwardly biased confidence levels in our estimates of manager skill, leading to persistent Type 1 errors (believing an estimate is  statistically significant when it is not).  Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003) certainly questioned the ben- efits of more frequent and more detailed performance measurement. They suggested that the cost of daily stock-level attribution is difficult to justify  (although given recent developments in technology their views may have  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

They suggested that monthly modified Dietz calculations might actually be near the optimum balance and that a simple alternative might be  running actual profit and loss for each position.3  Frongello (2006), in contrast, made the case for daily attribution analysis. He explained that in the real world, risk factor mismatches may occur unin- tentionally—caused by neglect, accidents, or simply changes in the risk pro- file of securities. Performance attribution should seek to explain performance resulting from all risk factor mismatches. Daily attribution is the best method  for monitoring the status and consequence of risk factor mismatches (p. 367).  Zangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) suggested that daily attribution, if done methodically, should produce results that are superior to monthly attri- bution. They pointed out that regardless of the methodology used, what is ultimately critical is the process governing attribution. The five core compo- nents of what they considered to be a good return attribution process are as  follows:  1. Data management and quality control. This task is the most important. Positions, prices, corporate actions, and so on, must be accurately cap-  tured, processed, and incorporated.  2. Infrastructure. Without proper infrastructure (efficient application of',\n",
       " 'hardware and databases), the chance of errors and delays increases.  3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.  3. Analytics. Algorithms perform the attribution calculations.  4. Methods. For example; daily buy-and-hold, monthly buy-and-hold, and  transaction-based attribution.  5. Reports. The way in which information is presented is important, so  timely, accurate, and easy-to-understand attribution reports are necessary.  Zangari and Bayraktar (2005/2006) concluded that process plays a criti- cal part in determining the accuracy of attribution results. Return attribution should be based on a process that monitors key input data and evaluates attri-  bution results on a daily basis.  Attribution of Money-Weighted Return. For purposes of comparative analysis, most attribution analysis is naturally undertaken on time-weighted rates of return (TWR). Attribution analysis of money-weighted rates of return (MWR) is less common. Yet, attribution analysis of MWR is still  undertaken in the form of the modified Dietz return calculation method.  3The modified Dietz method is a mathematical technique to evaluate a portfolio’s return based on a weighted calculation of its cash flow. The method takes into account the timing of  cash flows and assumes a constant rate of return over a specified period of time.  32  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  It was, in fact, recommended by Menchero and Hu (2003) in the context of transaction-based attribution and by Darling and MacDougall (2002/2003). O’Shea and Jeet (2018) suggested single-period attribution of modified Dietz returns for private equity. Spaulding and Campisi (2007) made the case for money-weighted attribution. They suggested that because cash flow move- ments are a factor that defines the investment process, these cash flows must be part of the performance measurement and evaluation system instead of  being neutralised (as occurs in the time-weighted calculation).  The modified Dietz method is a first-order approximation of the internal rate of return (IRR) and, according to Bacon (2007a), an intermediate step in the evolution from calculating IRR (which some might describe as a true MWR) to the true TWR. The IRR is a standard return measure for illiquid asset classes—such as private equity, real estate, and infrastructure—and is common at the total-asset owner level, where comparative analysis is less rel- evant. The modified Dietz method is easy to disaggregate and more straight- forward to attribute than the IRR. Nevertheless, Illmer and Marty (2003) and Illmer (2009) offered a solution to the attribution of the true MWR in',\n",
       " 'terms of both return and profit and loss.  D’Alessandro (2016) suggested analysts should end the debate about which method of return to use, TWR or MWR, and require the presentation  of both with an attribution between the two.  Conclusion: The Evolution of Attribution Methodologies  The evolution of attribution analysis is clear, easy to trace, and illustrated in Figure 9, which maps, not necessarily in chronological order, the major  developments in attribution analysis discussed in this review.  Comparative performance measurement starts with the BAI (1968) study, but attribution analysis itself starts with Fama (1972). From that point, a divergence occurs between asset-grouping and variance-type attribution, with the UK SIA (1972) introducing the concept of selection, allocation, and notional portfolios and return-based attribution developed a little later by Sharpe (1992), Fama and French (1993), Carhart (1997), and many others. Fixed-income attribution naturally veers in a different direction via Wagner and Tito (1977), who replaced beta with duration in the Fama decomposition, and Lord (1997), who responded to the investment decision processes of bond  managers, which are so different from those of equity managers.  Very early, a split occurred between, on the one hand, the dominant arithmetic Brinson and Fachler (1985) and Brinson et al. model (1986) and, on the other hand, the total level geometric approach of Holbrook (1977).  Smoothing and linking algorithms were soon needed in order for multiperiod  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  33  Performance Attribution  Figure 9.

Algorithms started to be published several years after their initial use in Carino (1999), soon followed by GRAP (1997), Menchero (2000), Frongello (2002a, 2002b), and Bonafede et al. (2002). Allen (1991) is a direct link from Holbrook but addressed multicurrency issues. Burnie et al. (1998), together with Bain (1996) and Bacon (2002), developed geometric selection and allocation calcu-  lations that were missing from Holbrook (1977) and from Allen. Ankrim and  34  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  Hensel (1992) and, with more success, Karnosky and Singer (1994) adapted the basic Brinson model for multicurrency attribution, including, importantly, taking into account interest rate differentials. Van Breukelen (2000) adapted  the Brinson model for successive portfolio fixed-income attribution.  Figure 9 firmly cements Brinson and Fachler (1985) at the centre of developments in attribution analysis. In more recent years, we have seen many variants of yield-curve decomposition models, which reflects the diver- sity of fixed-income investment decision processes. Because of low uptake, risk-adjusted attribution is not illustrated here but could be represented by a  link between return-based methods and the Brinson model.

This article sets out to define arithmetic and geometric excess returns. The author explains that the choice of an arithmetic or geometric attribution method is really a choice between using arithmetic or geometric excess return, and he expresses a preference for geometric excess returns based on compoundability, convertibility, and proportionality. Finally, the author presents a geometric attribution model that, although developed indepen-  dently, is actually identical to that of Burnie, Knowles, and Teder (1998).

The author illustrates and explains the evolution of return calculations from internal rates of return to true time-weighted rates of return. In summary, the author suggests that time-weighted forms of attribution will remain  dominant because of the following:  • The time-weighted rate of return is most appropriate for comparisons  of managers.  36  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  • Internal rates of return assume a constant rate of return difficult to  attribute.  e Investment decisions are independent of the total amount invested.

The author concludes that there is no single correct way to link single- period arithmetic effects to produce multiperiod effects. The appropriate methodology is generally one of personal preference. The most relevant question for the reader is not which method is correct but whether the reader  understands where these effects are included in the chosen methodology.  Bonafede, Julia K., Steven J.

First, it provided the general framework for the decomposition of portfolio return into selection, allocation, and interaction effects (although this last piece is described as “other” in the paper). Second, and more controversially, the paper made the observation that policy decisions make by far the biggest  contribution to the differences in returns among pension funds.

The proposal in this paper is that although the case is irrefutable for accept- ing the time-weighted return as the preferred method for measuring the return of an asset manager, an equally compelling case can be made for accepting the money-weighted return as the appropriate method for evalu- ating the source of that active return; that is, the money-weighted return is  the correct method for performance attribution.  Campisi, Stephen. 2004b. “Debunking the Interaction Myth.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 8 (4): 63–70.  The author refutes the idea of “interaction” and demonstrates that interac- tion arises from either a poor attribution model or a poor implementation of a sound attribution model. When a sound attribution model is imple- mented correctly, the interaction effect is eliminated. Despite the appearance of mathematical rigor in the calculation of interaction, investors and clients  understand that interaction is not a legitimate part of the investment process.

Twist is a steepening or flattening of the curve, and curvature occurs when a curve becomes more or less humped. The authors suggest an approach to decomposing curve changes that cir- cumvents the difficulties inherent in principal components analysis and  model fitting.

This article proposes a risk-adjusted performance attribution analysis that integrates risk measures with the Brinson models of attribution. The ben- efit is that it allows analysts to decompose the excess portfolio return into components of risk allocation, selection, and net selectivity that are addi-  tive and consistent with financial theory.

The author reviews popular linking methodologies and provides descrip- tions and examples of small differences. His conclusion is that although the mathematics may differ greatly from one method to another, the story  told by the resulting attribution is the same regardless of the method.

Giguere, Claude. 2005. “Thinking through Fixed Income Attribution— Reflections from a Group of French Practitioners.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 9 (4): 46–65.  The author provides reflections on a group of practitioners whose objectives were to review the theoretical and methodological aspects of fixed-income attribution and to define best practices. In the context of fixed income, this  group agreed to the following:  • Excess return is generally low; therefore, methodologies must be accu-  rate with small residuals.  The attribution results must match the investment decision process.  • The price differential between the portfolio and the benchmark is not  an effect attributable to the manager.  • The calculation frequency should be as high as possible to avoid distortion.  The group described two types of attribution:  1. Yield-curve decomposition, which breaks down performance into passage of time, yield-curve movements (however described), and spread  variations. This analysis is mostly intended for portfolio managers.  46  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation. All rights reserved.  Performance Attribution  2.

Building on the work of Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986), the authors suggest that if US T-bills are the appropriate naive alternative for US investors, then asset allocation away from T-bills is, as commonly thought, the single decision with the greatest impact on an investor’s return. But if a diversified mix is the alternative, then the impact of departing from this alternative may be no greater than the impact of other decisions, including  security selection.  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The authors suggest that the “associative” property is necessary for attri- bution linking. Among the popular smoothing/linking methods, they show that Carino (1999) and Frongello (2002a) are associative, whereas Menchero (2000) and various ad hoc methods are not.

The most important work written on performance attribution in the 1990s, this book develops an analytical framework for evaluating global asset markets and uses that framework to construct a performance attribution system that isolates the effects of market allocation, currency management,  and security selection on global portfolios.  This book is important for demonstrating that a multinational portfolio is suboptimally managed if currency is not managed independently and for demonstrating the importance of interest rate differentials between  currencies.

Laker, Damian. 2000. “What Is This Thing Called ‘Interaction’?” Journal of  Performance Measurement 5 (1): 43–57.  In this paper, the author suggests that the interaction term has a bad reputation. He states that portfolio managers do not distinguish between interaction and error terms but arbitrarily add them to other terms. As a  result, they find interaction difficult to explain to clients.  The author argues that the interaction term is sometimes more explanatory than the other attributes and that attempts to avoid confusion by “getting rid of ” the interaction term in a Brinson model are, in fact, likely to create  more confusion.

The author defines transaction-based attribution, holdings-based attribu- tion, and transaction-based attribution that identifies transaction costs, and he provides worked examples of each. The paper explains that the simplicity, reduced number of calculations, and reduced data burden of  holdings-based attribution come at the cost of accuracy.

Lord, Timothy J. 1997. “The Attribution of Portfolio and Index Returns in  Fixed Income.” Journal of Performance Measurement 2 (1): 45–57.  This paper focuses on performance attribution as it applies to fixed-income portfolios and indexes. More clearly described as bottom-up contribution analysis of the portfolio compared with its benchmark, this paper emphasizes the requirement for the attribution to be consistent with the investment strategy of the portfolio manager. Income and price returns are calculated separately. Price return is then attributed according to duration, yield-curve distribution, sector allocation, and issue selection. Shift and twist are considered components of duration return; and sector and specific issuer effects are considered components of spread return. Included also are a calendar return (the price return resulting solely from the passage of time) and a residual return (the difference between the actual return and  the model’s estimate of return).  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Menchero, Jose G., and Junmin Hu. 2003. “Errors in Transaction-Based  Performance Attribution.” Journal of Performance Measurement 8 (1): 57–69.  The authors identify three types of transaction-based attribution: true time-weighted methods that use a buy-and-hold assumption and two types of transaction-based attribution based on modified Dietz return calcula- tions. The two latter types are as follows: Type 1, which accounts for exter- nal and internal cash flows, and Type 2, which accounts for internal cash flows only. The authors acknowledge that the holdings-based approach will lead to differences between the actual return and the computed return, but they suggest that the magnitude should be small and typically depend on volatility and portfolio turnover. They suggest that this difference should be attributed to trading effects. The authors show that both Type 1 and Type 2 approaches will lead to attribution errors, so they ultimately prefer  the holdings-based approach.

The author, building on Sharpe (1988), suggests a 12-asset-class model that determines the passive return of a notional portfolio having the same style as the asset manager. The manager’s selection return is the difference  between the actual return and the passive return in the same style.  SIA. 1972. The Measurement of Portfolio Performance for Pension Funds.  Society of Investment Analysts.  Toward the end of 1970, a working group was set up by the UK Society of Investment Analysts to make recommendations on the subject of portfolio performance measurement for pension funds. The resulting report spe- cifically puts forward methods of calculating portfolio performance, thus  making possible a general comparison of funds.  The approach recommended has two aims: (1) the calculation of a rate of return for comparing funds and (2) the decomposition of the performance of a fund into two components—selection of stocks and selection of sec- tors. This report is, therefore, really the starting point of performance attri- bution because it both defines stock selection and sector allocation (called  “sector selection” in the report) and provides a worked example.

This paper demonstrates that a derivatives position can be represented as a series of (normally, two or more) notional asset exposures representing physi- cal securities and any implied borrowing used to finance the security position. Standard performance attribution techniques can be used on notional assets  to represent the derivatives in terms of the underlying investment decisions.  Surz, Ronald J. 1999/2000. “Attribution with Style.” Journal of Performance  Measurement 4 (2): 50–64.  This paper makes the case that manager style is a powerful determinant of performance. Style-based attribution produces much more reliable indicators than sector-based methods because most investment managers manage to a style rather than to some mix of economic sectors. Using sector-  based attribution analysis can produce significantly misleading inferences.  Van Breukelen, Gerard. 2000. “Fixed Income Attribution.” Journal of  Performance Measurement 4 (4): 61–68.

The author lists the pros and cons of the arithmetic and geometric methods and concludes the geometric method is clearly superior in almost every way. The author states that the arithmetic method produces a distortion when applied to multiple-period attribution because returns naturally compound geometrically, not arithmetically. Nothing can be done to improve the arithmetic method to overcome this basic fact. What is not so well known is that the arithmetic method produces a distortion even for a single period when multiple currencies are involved. In conclusion, the author suggests a  method that is computed geometrically and presented arithmetically.

The net return from selectivity (“net selectivity,” for short) is the remain- ing return from selectivity after deducting the amount of return required to  justify not being fully diversified:  Net selectivity = Selectivity — Diversification.  Net selectivity = Selectivity – Diversification.  Net selectivity = Sy,, =a—d.  Net selectivity =  If net selectivity is negative, the portfolio manager has failed to justify the  loss of diversification.  Timing is the return from the manager’s variations in systematic risk  (beta) around some policy or target amount:  (4)  where B, = the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  where  the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.

       "\"Fama Decomposition, introduced by Eugene Fama in 1972, is a method for analyzing the sources of return in an investment portfolio. It breaks down the portfolio's performance into different components to understand the contribution of various factors. The key components include:\\n\\n1. **Systematic Risk (Beta)**: The return from the portfolio's exposure to market risk, measured by beta, plus the risk-free rate.\\n\\n2. **Selectivity**: The return from the manager's ability to select securities that outperform the market.\\n\\n3. **Diversification**: The impact of not being fully diversified, which is the difference between the Fama beta and the portfolio beta.\\n\\n4. **Net Selectivity**: The remaining return from selectivity after accounting for the cost of not being fully diversified.\\n\\n5. **Timing**: The return from the manager's ability to vary systematic risk (beta) around a target or policy amount.\\n\\nFama's decomposition is foundational in performance attribution, helping to identify how much of a portfolio's return is due to market movements versus the manager's skill.\""

The net return from selectivity (“net selectivity,” for short) is the remain- ing return from selectivity after deducting the amount of return required to  justify not being fully diversified:  Net selectivity = Selectivity — Diversification.  Net selectivity = Selectivity – Diversification.  Net selectivity = Sy,, =a—d.  Net selectivity =  If net selectivity is negative, the portfolio manager has failed to justify the  loss of diversification.  Timing is the return from the manager’s variations in systematic risk  (beta) around some policy or target amount:  (4)  where B, = the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.  where  the investor’s systematic risk or target risk.

      "Source: Redrawn from a diagram in Fama (1972).  of portfolio performance measurement for pension funds. Its approach, eventually published in 1972 (SIA 1972), had two aims: (1) the determination of a standard method of calculating a portfolio’s return, so that funds could be fairly compared, and (2) the decomposition of the performance of the fund into two components—selection of individual stocks and selection of stock sectors. The first aim is achieved by calculating the time-weighted rate of return using a simple approximation (which later became known as the analyst’s test method and ultimately became redundant as more accurate time-weighted returns became available). The second aim, the analysis of performance, is produced by constructing “notional funds” based on market  indexes and comparing them with actual funds.  This early work dealt with equity-market sectors as the macro level of selection and securities within the sectors as the micro level, but common practice now is to regard asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as the macro level and securities within the asset class as the micro level. Thus, our discussion  will proceed from this latter starting point.  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  The working group established two notional funds as follows:  e a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  a fully restrained fund (index returns, benchmark weights) and  e apartly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  a partly restrained fund (index returns, actual weights).  Note that the actual fund consists of actual returns and actual weights. The fully restrained fund (sometimes called the “fully notional fund”) represents the return on the policy portfolio—that is, the strategic bench-  mark or policy weights set by the asset owner (represented by the pension  6  © 2019 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The decomposition aims to break down portfolio returns into various components to understand the contribution of different investment decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Components of Fama Decomposition\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Systematic Risk (Beta):**\n",
      "   - Represents the return from the portfolio's exposure to market risk.\n",
      "   - Calculated using the portfolio's beta, which measures sensitivity to market movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Selectivity:**\n",
      "   - Measures the ability of the portfolio manager to select securities that outperform the market.\n",
      "   - Calculated as the difference between the actual portfolio return and the return expected from systematic risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Diversification:**\n",
      "   - Assesses the impact of not being fully diversified.\n",
      "   - The return required to justify lack of diversification is calculated using the difference between the Fama beta and the portfolio beta.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Net Selectivity:**\n",
      "   - The remaining return from selectivity after accounting for the cost of not being fully diversified.\n",
      "   - If negative, it indicates a failure to justify the loss of diversification.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Timing:**\n",
      "   - Evaluates the return from variations in systematic risk (beta) around a target or policy amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Implications of Fama Decomposition\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Performance Attribution:**\n",
      "   - Provides a detailed breakdown of portfolio performance, helping investors understand the sources of returns.\n",
      "   - Enables identification of successful investment strategies and areas needing improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Investment Strategy Evaluation:**\n",
      "   - Helps in assessing the effectiveness of security selection and market timing strategies.\n",
      "   - Offers insights into the benefits and costs of diversification.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Risk Management:**\n",
      "   - By analyzing systematic risk, investors can better manage exposure to market volatility.\n",
      "   - Encourages a balanced approach to risk and return.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Benchmarking:**\n",
      "   - Facilitates comparison of portfolio performance against benchmarks, aiding in the evaluation of investment managers.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Decision-Making:**\n",
      "   - Informs strategic asset allocation and tactical adjustments based on performance insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Fama's decomposition provides a foundational framework for understanding investment performance. By dissecting returns into systematic risk, selectivity, diversification, and timing, it offers valuable insights for investors and portfolio managers to refine strategies and enhance decision-making.\n"
